# Torque and P-Factor

To the pilot, "torque" is the left turning tendency of the airplane, and is made up of
four elements:

 1. Torque reaction from engine and propellor.
 2. Corkscrewing effect of the slipstream.
 3. Gyroscopic action of the propellor.
 4. Asymmetric loading of the propellor (p-factor).

# Torque Reaction

Involves Newton's Third Law: every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means
that as the engine and propellor revolve in one direction, an equal and opposite reaction
is trying to spin the airplane in the opposite direction.

**In the US, propellors generally rotate clockwise as viewed from the pilot's seat.**

When the airplane is airborne, this force acts around the longitudinal axis, making the
aircraft try to roll:

 * Many *older* aircraft are rigged to create more lift on the wing being forced downward.
 * More *modern* aircraft often have the engine offset to counteract this force.

Generally these offsets are permanently set for cruising speed, so any condition that
isn't cruise will require compensation.

Specifically, on the ground the torque results in the left side of the airplane being
forced down, creating more weight on the left tire, and resulting in a left turning
tendency. The magnitude depends on:

 * Size and horsepower of the engine
 * Size and RPM of propellor
 * Size of the aircraft
 * Condition of the ground surface

The yawing moment on the takeoff roll is corrected by rudder input.

# Corkscrew Effect

The high speed rotation of the propellor results in a spiral slipstream. At high RPM
and low forward speed (such as takeoff), the slipstream is compact and **exerts a
strong sideways force on the vertical tail surface.**

On the ground, this force exerts a yawing moment around the vertical axis. The more
compact the spiral, the more prominent the force. As the aircraft accelerates the
slipstream elongates and the effect is less. It also causes a rolling moment when
airborne (and on the ground to some degree).

Note: the corkscrew flow of the slipstream causes a rolling moment to the **right**,
but the torque reaction is to the **left**, so these cancel each other out somewhat,
although during different parts of flight the effects of each will be changing all
the time.

# Gyroscopic Action

Recall that practical applications of the gyroscope are based on two fundamental
properties:

 1. Rigidity in space
 2. Precession

We're interested in precession, which is the deflection of a spinning rotor when
a deflecting force is applied to its rim. **The resulting force takes effect 90
degrees ahead of and in the direction of rotation**, causing a pitching moment,
a yawing moent, or a combination of the two, depending on the point at which
the force was applied.

This element of torque effect is more prominent in tailwheel aircraft, particularly
when the tail is raised on the takeoff roll.

**This change in pitch attitude has the same effect as applying a force to the
top of the propellor's plane of rotation.** The resultant force acts 90 degrees
ahead, and causes a yawing moment to the left around the vertical axis.

It can be said that, as a result of gyroscopic action, any yawing results in a
pitching moment, and any pitching results in a yawing moment. The pilot needs to
compensate for either with elevator and rudder.

# Asymmetric Loading (P-Factor)

**When an aircraft is flying with a high AOA, the *downward* moving blade has a
higher angle of attack than the *upward* moving blade.**

This moves the center of thrust to the right of the prop disc area, causing a
yawing moment to the left.
