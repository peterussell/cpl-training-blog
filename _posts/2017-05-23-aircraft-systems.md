# Reciprocating Engines

 * Make up most small aircraft engines.
 * 'Reciprocating' from pistons moving back and forth.
 * Convert chemical energy (fuel) to mechanical energy.
 * **Two primary designs:**
   1. **Spark Ignition:** involves a spark igniting a pre-mixed fuel-air mixture.
   2. **Compression Ignition:** compresses air to a high enough temperature that
      fuel automatically ignites when injected into the cylinder. Also called
      **jet fuel piston engines.**
 * These two designs can be futher classified:
   * Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft (radial, in-line, v-type,
     opposed)
   * Operating cycle (2 or 4)
   * Cooling method (liquid or air)

**Engine Arrangements**

 * **Radial**
   * Widely used during WW2
   * Main advantage is power-to-weight ratio.
 * **In-Line**
   * Comparatively small frontal area.
   * Rear cylinders receive less cooling, so usually limited to 4- or 6-cylinders.
 * **V-type**
   * Provide more horsepower than in-line engines, and still retain a small
     frontal area.
 * **Horizontally Opposed**
   * The most popular reciprocating engines used on small aircraft.
   * Always have an even number of cylinders (since each is opposed by another).
   * Majority are air-cooled and horizontally mounted.
   * High power-to-weight ratio because they have a comparatively small, light
     crankcase.
   * Also reduces frontal area, allows streamlining and minimized drag.

**Stroke Type**

Two Stroke:

 * Intake, compression, power, and exhaust cycles occur in 2 piston strokes.
 * Because each crankshaft revolution has a power stroke, it typically has a
   higher power-to-weight ratio than a 4-stroke engine.
 * Due to inefficiencies and emissions problems with early engines, they were
   ruled out of aviation, but modern advances (eg. fuel injection, pressurized
   air) are making them a viable alertnative to 4-stroke engines now.

Four Stroke:

 * Spark ignition 4-stroke engines are the most common in GA today.
 * Main parts are cylinders, crankcase, and accessory housing.
   * Intake/exhaust valves, spark plugs, and pistons are housed in the cylinders.
   * Crankshaft and connecting rods are located in the crankcase.
   * Magnetos are normally located in the engine accessory housing.
 * Four stage process:
   1. **Intake stroke**: piston moves down, intake valve opens, fuel-air
      mixture drawn into the cylinder.
   2. **Compression stroke**: intake valve closes, piston moves up and compresses
      fuel-air mixture.
   3. **Power stroke**: fuel-air mixture ignited, explosion forces the piston
      down, creating power to turn the crankshaft.
   4. **Exhaust stroke**: exhaust valve opens, piston moves up, forces out
      exhaust gases.
 * In a four-cylinder engine, each cylinder operates on a different stroke,
   continuous rotation of the crankshaft is maintained by precise timing of
   the power strokes in each cylinder.

**Diesel/Jet-A Engines**

 * *Frank Thielert* pioneered using a diesel type engine powered by aviation
   fuel kerosene.
 * Diesel and kerosene are similar, and aircraft running on a diesel piston
   engine provide **more independence, higher reliability, lower consumption,
   and lower operating costs**.
 * Thielert formed Thielert Aircraft Engines (TAE) in 1999, and developed
   Jet-A burning diesel engines. These are now certified and used in the
   Diamond DA40 single and DA42 Twin Star. They also have STCs for Cessna
   172s and Piper PA-28s.

# Propellor

 * Propellors are airfoils, so are subject to induced drag, stalls, and other
   aerodynamic principles that apply to any airfoil.
 * They provide thrust to pull (or push) aircraft through the air.
 * Engine turns the propellor, which produces thrust. The amount of thrust
   depends on airfoil shape, AOA, and RPM.
 * Propellors are twisted so blade angle changes from hub to tip.
   * The greatest angle of incidence (highest AOA) is at the **hub**, while
     the smallest AOA is at the tip.
   * The reason is to provide uniform lift along the blade, where points
     along the blade are traveling at different speeds (hub=slow, tip=fast).
 * Small aircraft either have  **fixed-pitch** or **adjustable-pitch**
   propellors.
