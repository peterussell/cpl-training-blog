# Spatial Disorientation & Illusions

Spatial disorientation refers to the lack of orientation with regard to position,
attitude, or movement of the airplane in space. The body uses three systems to
ascertain orientation:

 * **Vestibular system:** inner ear.
 * **Somatosensory system:** nerves in the skin, muscles, joints, as well as
   hearing, based on gravity, feeling, and sound.
 * **Visual system:** eyes.

This information comes together in the brain and usually agrees, but flying can
sometimes provide conflicting information. In VMC this isn't usually a problem,
but in IMC can quickly become disoreinting.

**Vestibular System**

 * Consists of three canals in the inner ear, at approximately right-angles to
   each other. Each is filled with fluid and has a section full of fine hairs.
 * Acceleration in any direction moves the fluids, deflects the hairs, and
   stimulates nerves which signal to the brain acceleration in the plane
   corresponding to the particular canal.

**Somatasensory System**

 * Sends signals from skin, joints, muscles to the brain, and are interpreted
   in relation to the Earth's gravitational pull.
 * 'Seat of the pants' flying is largely based on these sensations.
 * Used with vestibular *and visual* clues these signals can be fairly reliable.
 * **However - the body cannot distinguish between acceleration forces due to
   gravity and those from aircraft maneuevers**, which can lead to sensory
   illusions.

# Vestibular Illusions

**The Leans**

 * The most common illusion during flight.
 * Caused by a sudden return to level flight following a gradual and prolonged
   turn.
 * **Cause:** rotational acceleration under 2 degrees/second is below the
   detection threshold of the semicircular canals.
 * Leveling the wings after such a turn may create the illusion that the aircraft
   is banking in the opposite direction. In response, the pilot may turn the
   aircraft back in the direction of the original turn (instead of straight-and-
   level).

**Coriolis Illusion**

 * A movement of the head in a different plane, eg. looking at something in a
   different part of the flight deck, may set the fluid moving, creating the
   illusion of acceleration on an entirely different axis.
 * This causes the pilot to think the aircraft's performing a maneuver it's not.
 * For this reason, it's important to develop an instrument cross-check that
   involves minimal head movement, and be aware of the implications of any large
   head movements.

**Graveyard Spiral**

 * As in other illusions, results from a prolonged, coordinated, constant-rate
   turn.
 * During recovery to level flight, the pilot experiences a turn in the
   opposite direction, causing them to return to the original turn.
 * Because this results in a loss of lift (and the pilot thinks they're in level
   flight), they might pull back on the yoke to maintain altitude. This tightens
   the turn and increases the loss of altitude.

**Somatogravic Illusion**

 * A rapid acceleration, eg. takeoff, stimulates the otolithic organs in the same
   way as tilting the head backwards.
 * **Acceleration causes the same illusion as being in a nose-up attitude.**
 * The pilot may compensate by pushing the nose forward when it's not required.
 * The same illusion is experienced with deceleration, causing the illusion of
   a nose-down attitude.

**Inversion Illusion**

 * Abrupt change **from climb to straight-and-level** can create the illusion of
   tumbling backwards.
 * The pilot may push the controls forward, which would intensify the illusion.

**Elevator Illusion**

 * **Abrupt upward vertical acceleration**, eg. an updraft.
 * Can stimulate the otolithic organs to create the illusion of being in a climb
   (pushes the fluid down).
 * Pilot may push the nose down incorrectly.
 * Opposite occurs in sudden loss of altitude, eg. downdraft, pilot may raise the
   nose into a dangerous nose-up attitude.
