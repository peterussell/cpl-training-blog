# Pressurized Aircraft

Aircraft are flown at higher altitudes for two reasons:

 1. Aircraft are more efficient at higher altitudes, they consume less fuel
    for a given airspeed than at a lower altitude.
 2. To avoid bad weather and turbulence.

Aircraft that fly at higher altitudes either need to be pressurized, or provide
oxygen for occupants.

 * In typical systems, the **cabin, flight compartment, and baggage compartments**
   are a sealed unit capable of containing higher pressure air than outside the
   aircraft.
 * **Turbine aircraft** can use bleed air from the engine compressor to
   pressurize the cabin.
    * Older model turbine aircraft may use a supercharger to pump air into the
      sealed fuselage.
 * **Piston aircraft** may use air supplied from each engine turbocharger through
   a **sonic venturi (flow limiter)**.
 * Air is released from the fuselage by a device called an **outflow valve**.

**Inflow air is constant, the outflow valve regulates the pressure in the
pressurized area.**

 * Pressurization is typically at about 8,000' at max designed cruising altitude,
   to prevent rapid changes of cabin altitude that may be uncomfortable or
   dangerous to occupants.
 * The pressurization system also allows reasonably fast exchange of air from
   inside to outside of the airplane, to prevent against odors and stale air.
 * Pressurization guards against hypoxia. Flight crew must be aware of the danger
   of loss of cabin pressure.

**Pressurization & Air Conditioning Terms**

 * **Aircraft altitude:** actual height of aircraft above sea level.
 * **Ambient temperature:** temp in the area surrounding the aircraft.
 * **Ambient pressure:** pressure in the area surrounding the aircraft.
 * **Cabin altitude:** cabin pressure in terms of equivalent alt. above sea level.
 * **Differential pressure:** difference in pressures acting on either side of a
   wall. In this case, difference between cabin and atmospheric pressure.

**Cabin Pressure Control System**

 * Provides cabin pressure regulation, pressure relief, vaccum relief, and a
   means to select the desired cabin altitude in isobaric and differential
   range. Also ability to dump cabin pressure.
 * The **cabin pressure regulator** controls cabin pressure to a selected value
   in the isobaric range, and limits cabin pressure to a preset differential
   range.
    * **Important:** When an aircraft reaches the altitude at which the difference
      between inside and outside is equal to the *highest differential pressure for
      which the fuselage is designed*, a further increase in altitude will result
      in a corresponding increase in cabin altitude.
    * The differential pressure is determined by cabin structural strength, and
      often relation of cabin size to probable areas of rupture, eg. windows/doors.
 * The **cabin air pressure safety valve** is a combination of pressure relief,
   vacuum relief, and dump valve.
    * The **pressure relief valve** prevents cabin pressure from exceeding the
      predetermined differential pressure.
    * The **vacuum relief** prevents ambient pressure from exceeding cabin
      pressure, by allowing outside air in when outside air pressure is higher
      than inside air.
    * The **dump valve** is activated by a flight deck switch. When the switch
      is positioned to 'ram', a solenoid valve opens and dumps cabin air into
      the atmosphere.

**Pressurization Instruments**

 * **Cabin Differential Pressure Gauge**: indicates difference between inside
   and outside pressure. Monitor to ensure max allowable differential pressure
   isn't exceeded.
 * **Cabin altimeter:** gives pressure altitude of cabin. Can be combined with
   cabin differential pressure gauge.
 * **Cabin rate-of-climb indicator:** indicates rate of climb or descent based
   on cabin pressure.

# Decompression

Decompression is the inability of the pressurization system to maintain its
designed pressure differential. Can be caused by pressurization system
malfunction, or aircraft structural damage.

Physiologically, decompressions fall into two categories:

 1. **Explosive decompression (< ~0.5s):** change in cabin pressure faster than
    the lungs can decompress. Possibly resulting in lung damage.
     * Normally, the time required to release air from the lungs without
       restrictions (eg. masks) is **0.2.seconds**.
     * Most authorities decompression faster than 0.5 seconds to be explosive
       and potentially dangerous.
 2. **Rapid decompression:** decompression where the lungs can decompress faster
    than the cabin.

**Explosive Decompression**

 * During an explosive decompression there may be noise, and a dazed feeling.
   The cabin fills with fog, dust, or flying debris.
    * Fog occurs due to the rapid drop in temperature and change of relative
      humidity.
    * Normally ears clear automatically. Air rushes from mouth and nose due to
      high pressure air escaping from the lungs, and may be noticed by some
      people.

**Rapid Decompression**

 * Decreases time of useful consciousness because high pressure air in the
   lungs is exhaled rapidly, reducing pressure in the body. This decreases
   **partial pressure of oxygen in the blood and reduces the pilot's effective
   performance time by 1/3 to 1/4 of its normal time.**
    * For this reason, oxygen masks should be worn when flying at very high
      altitudes (35,000' or above).
    * It's recommended that crewmembers select the **100% oxygen setting** on
      the oxygen regulator at high altitude if equipped.

**Decompression Dangers**

 * **Hypoxia:** the primary danger of decompression. Quick, proper utilization
   of oxygen equipment is required to avoid hypoxia.
 * **Evolved gas decompression sickness:** occurs when the pressure on the body
   drops sufficiently, and nitgrogen comes out of solution and forms bubbles
   inside the body, which can have adverse effects on some body tissues.
 * **Aircraft structural damage:** danger of occupants being blown out of the
   aircraft if near openings. Anyone near potential openings should wear
   safety belts when seated.
    * Wind blasts and extreme cold temperatures from openings are other potential
      hazards from aircraft structural damage.

Rapid decent from altitude is necessary to minimize these problems. Automatic
visual and aural warnings are included in all pressurized aircraft.
