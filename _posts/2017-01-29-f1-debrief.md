# Lesson Topics

**Ground**

 * Cockpit familiarisation
 * Engine out procedures:
   * Before 80 MPH: close throttles, apply brakes
   * After 80 MPH, gear down and runway remaining: close throttles, land, apply brakes
   * After 80 MPH, no runway: power up, clean up, identify, verify, fix or feather. Divert to HIO.
 * Systems overview: hydraulics, vacuum
 * Handpump procuedures:
   * Gear or flap lever up or down
   * Extend hand pump, pump until flaps or gear as required

**Flight**

 * Engine start, taxiing, runup
 * Takeoff briefing:
   * Identify runway
   * Pull on to runway and set brakes
   * Power to 1800 RPM, verify gauges in green
   * If engine's green, release brakes, advance throttles to full
   * Accelerate to 80 MPH and rotate, priority is Vmc + 5, = 85 MPH + 5 = 90MPH
   * At 80 MPH, committed to takeoff - take hand off throttles and both on yoke
   * No useable runway remaining, gear up, accelerate to Vyse = 102 MPH
   * At 1,000' AGL: throttles 24"Hg, props 2400 RPM, boost pumps off, Vcc = 120 MPH
     * **Checklist**
 * Normal takeoff
 * Climb out, gear didn't come up:
   * Gear in up position, extend pump handle and manually retract (Randy did the
     troubleshooting given it was a first fight)
 * Went to West Practice Area: **Frequency 122.75**
 * 20 degree turns, getting familiar with gear in and gear out, clearing turns
 * Steep turns
 * Power off stalls
 * Power on stalls
 * Fly to Scappoose (KSPB)
   * Remember 'over the confluence' as a reporting point for SPB and Pearson Field
 * Entered teardrop to left downwind, RWY 15.
 * Traffic pattern and landing:
   * ~ 20"Hg/2400 RPM downwind
   * **Before landing checklist**
   * Mixture rich, boost pumps on
   * Abeam numbers: power back to ~15"Hg/2400 RPM
   * Slow under Vlo = 125 MPH, extend gear (more hydraulic issues, Randy manually
     lowered gear)
     * **Remeber, gear lever should return to neutral, must manually return it if it
       doesn't do it by itself**
   * Slow under Vfe = 100 MPH, half flaps
     * **Remember to return flap lever to neutral position**
   * Vyse = 102 MPH **until final**
   * GUMPS check
   * Base: power set, Vyse
     * GUMPS check
   * Final, GUMPS - propellors full, slowing to 95 MPH
   * With a long enough runway, can leave in a little power to smooth landing
 * 2 landings at KSPB - one full stop, one touch and go
 * Back to Twin Oaks
   * Had to stay high over HIO airspace, too busy to transition, ended up having
     to do a descending right 360 into the 45 to left upwind for RWY 02
   * Short field landing: same as normal, except slow to 85 MPH on mid-short final,
     and make sure all power is out
 * 2 landings at Twin Oaks

**Flight time:

 * 1.8 hours Hobbs, 3 hours instruction

# What went well

 * Staying ahead of the airplane (thanks instrument training!), being set up with
   SPB weather, having traffic pattern diagrams written down and airport info
   read before the flight
 * Slow taxiing, good to remember that retractable gear can be less sturdy than fixed
 * Randy commented on smooth control inputs, important for CPL checkrides
 * Stalls were mostly good (Vmc issue with power-on stall)
 * Landings were smooth, well-flared and good sight picture, generally fairly
   precise but precision can use some work

# Things to improve

 * Steep turns:
   * Altitude was within +/- 100', but can improve on preempting the altitude drops,
     quite a bit more back pressure required than a Cessna 172
   * Need to improve maintaining bank angle, we did 45 degree turns but CPL standards
     are 50 degrees +/- 5. Randy mentioned an issue with the nose really wanting to
     drop at 50 degrees, so to use some of the -5 degrees to perform them probably
     around 47-48 degrees.
   * **Noticed after the flight that I'd been watching the TC for steep turns, should
     glance at it, but should use the AI as a primary instrument for bank indications
     (especially since the needle on the TC is so fat)**
 * Stalls:
   * Power off were OK, just need to memorise the sequence and power settings
   * Power on, hit Vmc before stall, and nose started sliding left, need to catch
     that and keep the nose centered.
 * Turns to final:
   * I overshot some of the turns to final, need to keep in mind that we're going
     faster than I'm used to and to fly a slightly wider pattern
 * Short field landings:
   * Landings were good, but need to work on precision to get them to CPL standards
 * Better use of checklists:
   * My checklist usage was ok, but need to be more timely about it. Ie. need to
     identify immediately that a phase of flight has changed and that a checklist
     should be done, not a minute or two after the phase of flight has changed.

# Next lesson

 * Vmc demo
 * Drag demo
 * Engine shutdown in cruise, single engine flight, engine restart
 * Simulated single engine landing at McMinville (KMMV)
   * Come in a little high, a little fast, *do not* want to go around single engine
   * Need to manage gear early, don't want it out so early that you're flying around
     with a lot of extra drag, but be mindful that it's easy to forget it while
     worrying about flying with an engine out
