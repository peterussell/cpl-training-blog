# Fuel Injection Systems

 * Fuel is inject directly into the cylinders, or just ahead of the intake
   valve.
 * The air intake for a fuel injected system is similar to a carb system, with
   an alternate air source located inside the engine cowling, used if the
   primary source is obstructed.
    * The alternate air source is normally activated automatically, with a
      backup manual system.

**Fuel Injection Components**

Fuel injection systems normally incorporate 6 components:

 1. Engine-driven fuel pump.
 2. Fuel-air control unit.
 3. Fuel manifold (fuel distributor).
 4. Discharge nozzles.
 5. Aux fuel pump.
 6. Fuel pressure/fuel flow indicators.

 * The **aux fuel pump** provides pressure for starting the engine and/or
   emergency use. After starting the engine, the **engine driven fuel pump**
   provides fuel pressure from the fuel tank to the fuel-air control unit.
 * The **fuel-air control unit** essentially replaces the carb. It meters
   fuel based on the mixture control setting, and sends it to the fuel
   manifold valve at a rate controlled by the throttle.
 * After reaching the **fuel manifold valve**, the fuel is distributed to the
   individual **fuel discharge nozzles**. The discharge nozzles, located in
   each cylinder head, inject the fuel-air mixture directly into each
   cylinder intake port.

Injected systems are generally less susceptible to icing than carb systems,
but impact icing on the air intake is possible in either system.

**Advantages**

 * Reduction in evaporative icing.
 * Better fuel flow.
 * Faster throttle response.
 * Precise control of mixture.
 * Better fuel distribution.
 * Easier cold-weather starts.

**Disadvantages**

 * Difficulty in hot-starting engines.
 * Vapor locks during ground operations on hot days.
 * Problems restarting an engine that quits due to fuel starvation.
