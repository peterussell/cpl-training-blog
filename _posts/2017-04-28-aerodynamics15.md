# Load Factors

The maximum load factor (at a given bank angle) is a proportion between lift and
weight. **The load factor is measured in Gs (acceleration of gravity).**

Any force applied to an aircraft to deflect its flight from a straight line
produces a stress on its structure. The amount of this force is the load
factor.

**For example, a load factor of 3** means the total load on an aircraft's structure
is three times its weight. Since load factors are measured in Gs, a load factor
of 3 could be called "3 Gs", or a load factor of 4 called "4 Gs".

The structural design of an aircraft is only planned to withstand a certain amount
of overload, so it's important to know the factors that contribute to load factors.
They're important for two reasons:

 1. It's possible for a pilot to impose a dangerous overload on the aircraft
 2. **An increased load factor increases stalling speed, and makes stalls possible
    at seemlingly safe flight speeds.**

# Load Factors in Aircraft Design

The problem of load factors in aircraft design becomes how to determine the highest
load factors that can be expected in *normal operation under various operational
situations.* These load factors are called limit load factors.** It's required the
aircraft is designed to *withstand these load factors without any structural
damage.* The CFRs require the aircraft stucture to be able to handle 1.5 times the
limit load factors without failure, but allows for bending or twisting of the
airframe. The 1.5 load limit factor is called the "factor of safety".

The above considerations apply to all loading conditions, which could be due to:

 * Gusts
 * Maneuvers
 * Landings

Generally, the *gust load factors* control the design of aircraft intended for
non-acrobatic use.

**Category System (normal, utility, acrobatic)**

In aircraft design based on maneuvering load factors, it's necessary to discuss
in terms of a) newer aircraft designed in accordance with the category system
(normal, utility, acrobatic), and b) older designs built to requirements outside
of the category system.

Aircraft built under the category system are identified by a placard in the flight
deck, showing the operational category (or categories) the aircraft is certified
in. The maximum safe load factors (limit load factors) for the categories are:

 * **Normal** - 3.8 to -1.52
 * **Utility** - 4.4 to -1.76
 * **Acrobatic** - 6.0 to -3.0

For aircraft with gross weight of more than 4,000lbs the limit load factor is
reduced.

For aircraft that do not have the category placard, these were designed under
earlier engineering requirements in which no operational restrictions were
specifically given to the pilots. For these, up to weights of about 4,000lbs,
the structural requirements are similar to the utility category. Above
4,000lbs, they are similar to the normal category.

# Load Factors in Steep Turns

At a constant altitude, during a coordinated turn, the **load factor is the result
of centrifugal force and weight**.

For any given bank angle, the ROT varies with airspeed -- higher the speed, the
slower the ROT. The load factor increases at a terrific rate after 45 - 50 degrees
of bank.

**The load factor for any aircraft in a coordinated, *level* turn at 60 degrees
of bank is 2Gs.** The load factor at 80 degrees is 5.76 Gs. The wing must produce
lift equal to these load factors if altitude is to be maintained.

For the average general aviation aircraft, the approximate maximum bank is 60
degrees. An additional 10 degree bank increases the load factor by approximately
1 G, bringing it close to the yield point established for these aircraft.
