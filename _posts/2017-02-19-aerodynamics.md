# Thrust, Drag, Lift, Weight

These are the four forces acting on an aircraft in straight-and-level flight:

 * **Thrust**
   * Forward force produced by the powerplant, and propellor(s) or rotor(s).
   * Opposes drag.
   * Generally parallel to the longitudinal axis, but not always the case (explained
     later).
 * **Drag**
   * Rearward force produced by disruption of airflow over the wing, rotor,
     fuselage, and other protruding objects.
   * Generally opposes thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative wind.
 * **Lift**
   * A force produced by the dynamic effect of the airfoil.
   * Acts perpendicular to the flight path, through the center of lift (CL) and
     perpendicular to the lateral axis.
   * In level flight, lift opposes the downward force of weight.
 * **Weight**
   * Combined weight of the aircraft, passengers, fuel, and cargo.
   * Pulls the aircraft downward due to the force of gravity.
   * Opposes lift and acts downward through the aircraft's center of gravity.

 > In *steady* flight, the sum of these opposing forces is always zero. This does
 > not mean the four forces are equal, it means the *opposing* forces are equal.

For example, in steady state, straight-and-level flight, the forces of thrust and
drag are equal, but those are often much smaller than the forces of weight and lift.

Therefore, **in steady flight** - including steady climbs and descents:

 * The sum of all upward components of forces (not just lift) equals the sum of
   all downward components of forces (not just weight).
 * The sum of all forward forces (not just thrust) equals the sum of all rearward
   forces (not just drag).

This also explains that in climbs and slow flight, a portion of thrust is directed
upward and acts as lift.

In a climb, a portion of weight is directed rearward and acts as drag *(Explanation:
weight still points to the center of the earth, but now the angle of the airplanes is
different, so the weight is pointing rearward relative to the airplane).*

However, in slow flight, the rearward pointing weight *doesn't* act as drag, because
drag acts parallel to the relative wind. In slow flight, the relative wind isn't the
same as the direction the airplane is pointed in - so the weight doesn't contribute
to drag, even though thrust still contributes to lift, perpendicular to the lat. axis.

In glides, a portion of the weight is directed along the forward flight path, and
therefore contributes to thrust.

 > In other words, any time the flight path of the aircraft is not horizontal, lift
 > weight, thrust, and drag must each be broken down into two components.

# Angle of Attack

The angle of attach is defined as the acute angle between the relative wind and
the chord line of the airfoil.
