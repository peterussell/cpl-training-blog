# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems

During climbs and descents, air in body cavities expands and contracts. If the
escape of expanded gas is restricted, pressure can build and become painful.

Trapped gas accounts for ear and sinus pain, as well as temporary reduction
in hearing ability.

 * The **middle ear** is a small cavity located in the bone of the skull. It's
   separated from the external ear canal by the eardrum.
 * Normally, pressure difference between the middle ear and the outside world are
   equalized by a tube connecting the middle ear to both sides of the back of the
   throat, called the **Eustachian tube.**
    * These tubes are normally closed, but open during chewing, yawning, or
      swallowing to equalize pressure.
 * Even a slight difference in pressure can cause discomfort.

 * During climbs, the higher pressure trapped in the middle ear can cause the
   eardrum to bulge outward. Similarly in descents, higher pressure outside can
   cause the eardrum to bulge inward.
 * This condition can be more difficult to relieve because of the partial
   vacuum which tends to constrict the walls of the Eustachian tube.

**Treatment**

 * Pinch the nostrils shut.
 * Close mouth and lips.
 * Blow slowly and gently into the mouth and nose.

This forces air through the Eustachian tube into the middle ear.

 * It may not be possible to equalize the pressure if the person has a cold,
   ear infection, or sore throat. Flight in these conditions can be extremely
   painful, as well as damaging to the eardrums.
 * If experiencing minor congestion, drops or nasal sprays may reduce the risk of
   a painful ear blockage. Check with an AME before using medication.

**Sinus Problems**

 * In a similar way, ear pressure in the sinuses equalizes with air in the flight
   deck through small openings that connect the sinuses to nasal passages.
 * An upper respiratory infection (eg. cold) can produce enough congestion to
   slow equalization. As pressure differential increases, congestion can be
   enough to block the openings, called a 'sinus block.'
 * Occurs most frequently during descents, slowing rate of descent can help.
 * A sinus block can occur in the **frontal sinuses** above each eyebrow, or
   in the **maxillary sinuses** located in the upper cheek.
 * Sinus block can also cause pain in the upper teeth, or cause a nasal discharge
   of bloody mucus.

**Prevention**

 * Can be prevented by not flying with upper respiratory infections.
 * Nasal decongestant sprays don't usually provide enough relief, and oral
   decongestants usually come with side effects which can impair pilot
   performance.
 * See a doctor if a sinus block doesn't clear shortly after landing.
