# Aircraft Design Characteristics

The following summarizes the more important aspects of an aircraft's stability,
maneuverability, and controllability; how they are analyzed; and their
relationship to various flight conditions.

# Stability

 > Stability is the inherent quality of an aircraft to correct for conditions
 > that may disturb its equilibrium and return to or continue on its original
 > flight path.

 * The flight paths and attitudes an aircraft flies are limited by:
    * The aerodynamic charactersitics of the aircraft
    * Its propulsion system
    * Its structural strength
 * If an aircraft is to fly straight and steady, the forces acting on it must
   be in **static equilibrium.**
 * **The reaction of any body when its equilibrium is disturbed is called
   its stability**.
 * There are two types: static, and dynamic.

**Static Stability**

Static stability is the **initial tendency**, or direction of movement, back
to equilibrium. In aviation it refers to the aircraft's initial response when
disturbed from a given pitch, yaw, or bank.

 * **Positive static stability:** the initial tendency is to return to the
   original state of equilibrium after being disturbed.
 * **Neutral static stability:** the initial tendency is to remain in a new
   condition after its equilibrium has been disturbed.
 * **Negative static stability:** the initial tendency is to continue away
   from the original state of equilibrium after being disturbed.

**Dynamic Stability**

Occasionally, the initial tendency (static stability) is different from the
overall tendency (dynamic stability), so a distinction must be made between
the two.

Dyanmic stability refers tothe aircraft response **over time** when disturbed
from a given pitch, yaw, or bank. It also has three subtypes:

 * **Positive dynamic stability:** over time, the motion of the displaced
   object decreases in amplitude, and because it is positive, the displaced
   object returns toward the equilibrium state.
 * **Neutral dynamic stability:** once displaced, the displaced object
   neither decreases nor increases in amplitude. eg. worn car shock absorber.
 * **Negative dynamic stability:** over time, the motion of the displaced
   object increases and becomes more divergent.

Stability in aircraft affects two areas significantly:

 * **Maneuverability**
    * How easily the aircraft can be maneuvered, and withstand the stresses
      imposed by the maneuvers.
    * Determined by aircraft weight, size, intertia, size and location of
      flight control surfaces, structural strength, and powerplant.
 * **Controllability**
    * Capability of an aircraft to respond to the pilot's controls,
      especially with regard to flight path and attitude.
    * Quality of the aircraft response to the pilot's inputs, *regardless
      of aircraft stability*.

Therefore, an aircraft can be unstable but highly maneuverable.

# **Study Questions:**

 * **What are the two types of stability, and what is the difference?**
    * Static stability and dynamic stability.
    * Static = initial tendency, dynamic = overall tendency
 * **What are the three types of tendencies for each?**
    * Positive - object has a tendency to return to equilibrium.
    * Neutral - object tends to continue on the displaced path (neither
      increases or decreases).
    * Negative - object tends away from equilibrium and becomes more
      divergent.
