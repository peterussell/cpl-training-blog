# Ant-Ice and Deice Systems

 * Anti-ice: prevent formation of ice.
 * Deice: remove ice once it's formed.

Protect the leading edge of wing and tail surfaces, pitot and static ports,
fuel tank vents, stall warning devices, windshields, and propellors.

Ice detection lighting may also be installed on some aircraft to determine the
extent of structural icing during night flights.

Smaller aircraft are often not certified for flight in icing, in which case
they must exist icing conditions immediately. Refer to AFM/POH for details.

# Deicing Boots

 * Inflatable deicing boots consist of a rubber sheet bonded to the leading edge
   of the airfoil.
 * When ice builds up on the airfoil, and engine-driven pneumatic pump inflates
   the boots (many turboprop aircraft divert engine bleed air).
 * Upon inflation, ice is cracked and should fall off.
 * Controlled from the flight deck, can be operated in single cycle, or allowed
   to cycle at automatic timed intervals.

**Deice Boot "Bridging"**

 * In the past, it was believed that if the boots were cyclted too soon after
   encountering ice, the ice layer could expand instead of breaking, and create
   an ice 'bridge'. Subsequent boot cycles would be innefective because they
   would only reach the bridge.
 * Although some residual ice may remain after a boot-cycle, "bridging" doesn't
   occur with any modern boots. Pilots can cycle the boots as soon as ice
   accumulation is observed. Consult the AFM/POH for boot operation.

**Boot Instrument Indications**

 * Many deicing boot systems use the suction and pneumatic pressure gauge to
   indicate proper boot operation.
    * These gauges have markings that **indicate the operating limits for boot
      operation.**
 * Some systems may also incorporate an annunciator light to indicate proper
   boot operation.

# Thermal Anti-Ice Systems

 * Heat provides one of the most effective for preventing ice accumulation on an
   airfoil.
 * High performance turbine aircraft often direct hot air from the compressor
   section of the engine to the leading edge surfaces.

**ThermaWing**

 * A newer type of thermal anti-ice system.
 * Uses **electrically heated graphite foil laminate** applied to the leading
   edge of the wing and horizontal stabilizer.
 * Typically have two zones: one on the *leading edge* receives continuous heat,
   one further aft which receives heat in cycles to dislodge ice, allowing
   aerodynamic forces to remove it.

**Thermal anti-ice systems should be activated prior to entering icing
conditions.**

**Weeping Wings**

 * Less common form of leading edge protection.
 * Antifreeze solution is pumped through small holes on the leading edge of the
   wing to prevent formation and build-up of ice.
 * Is also capable of deicing, application of the antifreeze solution breaks
   down the bond between ice and airframe, allowing aerodynamic forces to remove
   the ice.

# Windscreen Anti-Ice

Two main types:

 1. **Flow of alcohol to the windscreen**. If used early enough, prevents
    ice from building up. Rate of alcohol flow can be controlled by a dial in the
    flight deck.
 2. **Electric heating.** Small wires or other conductive material embedded in
    the windscreen. Switch on the flight deck causes a current to pass through
    the wires and provides sufficient heat to prevent formation of ice.
     * Should only be used during flight, continued operation on the ground can
       cause it to overheat and damage the windscreen.
     * **Warning:** electrical current can cause compass deviation errors as much
       as 40 degrees.

# Propellor Anti-Ice

 * Protected from icing by either alcohol or electrically heated elements.
 * Some are equipped with a discharge nozzle pointed toward the root of the
   blade. Alcohol is discharged from the nozzles and centrifugal force drives
   alcohol down the leading edges.
    * Boots are also grooved to direct flow of alcohol.
 * Can also be fitted with anti-ice boots.
    * Divide into two sections: inboard and outboard.
    * Have embedded electrical wires that carry current for heating the prop.
    * Can be monitored for proper operation by monitoring the **prop anti-ice
      ammeter.**
    * Need to be checked during preflight. **If one boot fails it can cause an
      unequal blade loading and can cause severe prop vibration.
