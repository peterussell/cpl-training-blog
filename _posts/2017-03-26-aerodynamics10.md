# Effect of Wing Planform

> A planform is the shape of the wing as viewed from directly above.

There are three important factors in planform design:

 * **Aspect Ratio**
   * The ratio of wing span to wing chord.
 * **Taper Ratio**
   * The decrease in wing chord (planform) or thickness from the wing root to tip.
 * **Sweepback**
   * The rearward slant of a wing, horizontal tail, or other airfoil surface.

There are two main ways of altering the planform design:

**Aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio is the primary factor in determining the three dimensional
characteristics of the ordinary wing and its lift/drag ratio.

 * An *increase* in aspect ratio:
    * Increase in wing span and/or decrease in wing chord (long, thin wing)
    * **Decreases drag** for a constant velocity, especially at high angles of attack.
    * Improves performance of the wing when in a climb attitude.
 * A *decrease* in aspect ratio:
    * Decrease in wing span and/or increase in wing chord (short, stubby wing)
    * **Increases drag** for a constant velocity

Note that the increased aspect ratio (long, thing wing) also comes with a
**weight penalty**, ie. the wing must be heavier to carry the same load. This
means some of the gain due to decreased drag is lost because of the increased
weight, so a compromise is required.

**Tapering**

Tapering is the second means of changing the planform, meaning the chord length
decreases from the wing root to the wing tip. It generally decreases drag (especially
at high speeds), increases lift, and reduces weight due to its smaller area compared
to an untapered wing.

**Aspect ratios on types of aircraft**

Most training and general aviation type airplanes require more lift at slow speeds,
meaning they're more forgiving. For this reason they often have high aspect ratio
wings.

Airplanes developed to operate at very high speeds demand greater aerodynamic
cleanness (less pieces sticking out) and greater strength, which require a low
aspect ratio wing. Very low aspect ratios result in high wing loadings and
high stall speeds.

When sweepback and low aspect ratios are combined they result in very different
handling characterstics to general aviation airplanes, especially at low speeds.

**Elliptical vs. Square Wings**

 * The elliptical wing is the ideal subsonic planform since it provides for a
   **minimum of induced drag for a given aspect ratio.**
 * It is more difficult to construct than a rectangular wing.
 * While it provides the best coefficients of lift before reaching an incipient
   stall, it gives little advance warning of a complete stall, and lateral
   control may be difficult because of poort aileron effectiveness.
 * In comparison, the rectangular wing tends to stall at the wing root first,
   and provides adequate stall warning and aileron effectiveness, and is
   usually quite stable.
 * Therefore, the rectangular wing is usually favoured in the design of low-cost,
   low-speed airplanes.


# **Study Questions**

 * **What is the aspect ratio of a wing's planform design?**
    * The ratio of wing span to chord length.
 * **Describe a high and low aspect ratio wing.**
    * High aspect ratio has a long wing span with a short chord length. It's long and
      skinny. Low aspect ratio wings have a short wing span and a long chord length;
      these are short and stubby wings.
 * **What effect on drag do high and low aspect ratio wings have?**
    * A high aspect ratio wing decreases drag, especially in climbs. A low aspect
      ratio wing increases drag.
 * **What is the design compromise in a planform design with regard to aspect ratio?**
    * A high aspect ratio wing is good because it reduces lift, but it often adds
      weight to be able to create the longer wing span. A compromise between these
      is necessary.
 * **What is tapering and what are the benefits?
    * Tapering is a reduction in chord length from the wing root to the wing tip. It
      generally decreases drag (most effective at high speeds) and increases lift. Because
      the wing has a smaller area compared to an untapered wing, it also reduces weight.
 * **What are some charactersitics of elliptical wings vs. rectangular wings?
    * Elliptical wings have a much better lift/drag ratio, but their stall characteristics
      don't often provide much warning or aileron effectiveness during the stall.
    * In contrast, rectangular wings have a worse L/D ratio, but tend to stall from
      the wing root outward, and provide good aileron effectiveness during the stall.
