# Electrical System

 * Most aircraft are equipped with either a 14-volt or 28-volt DC system.
 * Basic system consists of:
    * Alternator/generator.
    * Battery.
    * Master/battery switch.
    * Alternator/generator switch.
    * Bus bar, fuses, circuit breakers.
    * Voltage regulator.
    * Ammeter/loadmeter.
    * Wiring.
 * Alternators or generators supply current to the system, and keep the
   battery charged. The battery is used to start the engine, and provides
   limited power if the alternator/generator fails.
 * At **low RPM**, most **DC generators** don't provide enough electricity
   to power the electrical system, in which case current is drawn from the
   battery, which may become depleted.

**Alternators vs Generators**

Alternators have several advantages over generators:

 * They provide sufficient current at low RPM to power the electrical system.
    * This is done at slower engine speeds **by generating alternating current
      which gets converted to direct current**.
 * Electrical output of an alternator is more constant through a wide range of
   engine speeds.

**GPU**

 * Some aircraft have recepticals for a Ground Power Unit (GPU).
 * These can be particularly useful during cold weather operations.

**Operating the Electrical System**

 * Electrical system is turned on or off with a master switch. Turning it to
   the ON position provides electrical energy to **all electrical circuits
   except the ignition system.**
 * Many aircraft also have a **battery switch** that controls power to the
   aircraft in a similar manner to the master switch.
 * In addition, an **alternator switch** is installed which allows the pilot
   to exclude the alternator from the electrical system in case of an
   alternator failure.
    * With the alternator switch off, current comes from the battery. In this
      case all nonessential electrical items should be turned off.

**Electrical System Components**

 * A **bus bar** acts as a terminal, connecting the electrical system to the
   electrical equipment. This simplifies wiring and provides a common point
   for distributing electricity to the system.
 * **Fuses or circuit breakers** protect circuits and equipment from overload.
   If the aircraft uses fuses, spares of the correct amperage should be onboard.
    * Circuit breakers have the same function but can be manually reset.
    * Placards identify which circuit each fuse or CB is for.
 * An **ammeter** monitors whether the alternator/generator is providing an
   adequate supply of current, and whether the battery is receiving a charge.
    * Ammeters are designed with the zero-point in the center, and negative
      to the left/positive to the right.
    * When the needle is to the right, it shows the *charging rate of the
      battery*.
    * A negative indication means more current is being drawn from the battery
      than is being replaced.
       * A **full scale negative deflection** indicates a malfuction of the
         alternator/generator.
       * A **full scale positive deflection** indicates a malfuction of the
         regulator.
       * In either case consult the AFM/POH.
    * Not all aircraft have an ammeter, some just have a light indicating
      that the system's discharging.
 * Another type of monitoring indicator is a **loadmeter.** This has a scale
   starting at 0 and shows the load placed on the alternator/generator.
    * It reflects the total load placed on the electrical system by the
      battery and electrical accessories. When all components are turned off
      it indicates the load placed on it only by the battery.
 * A **voltage regulator** controls rate of charge to the battery by stabilizing
   the alternator/generator output.
    * The alternator/generator output should be *higher* than the battery
      voltage, eg. 14V generator, 12V battery. This difference keeps the battery
      charged.

# Hydraulic System

Hydraulic systems in small aircraft are often used to operate wheel brakes,
retractable landing gear, some constant speed propellors. On large airplanes
it's used for flight control surfaces, flaps, spoilers, and other systems.

A basic hydraulic system consists of:

 * Reservoir.
 * Pump (either hand, electric, or engine-driven).
 * Filter (to keep the fluid clean).
 * Selector valve (to control direction of flow).
 * Relief valve (to release excessp pressure).
 * Actuator.

 * Hydraulic fluid is pumped to an actuator or servo.
    * A **servo is a cylinder with a piston inside that turns fluid power into
      work**.
    * Servos can be either single-acting or double-acting, which means the fluid
      can be applied to one or both sides of the servo.
 * Selector valve allows fluid direction to tbe controlled, necessary for
   operations like extension and retraction of landing gear, in which case the
   fluid must work in two different directions.
 * The relief valve provides an outlet for the system in case of excessive
   fluid pressure.
 * A **mineral based hydraulic fluid** is most common for small aircraft. A
   kerosene-like petroleum product which has good lubricating properties, and
   additives to inhibit foaming and prevent formation of corrosion. It's
   chemically stable, has little viscosity change with temperature, and dyed
   for identification.

# Landing Gear

 * Most commonly wheels, but can be floats or skis.

**Tricycle Landing Gear**

Advantages:

 * Allows more forceful application of brakes without causing nose-over.
 * Better forward visibility.
 * Tends to prevent ground looping since the CG is forward of the main wheels,
   which keeps the airplane moving forward rather than ground looping.

Nosewheels can be steerable or castering. Steerable ones are linked to the
rudders by cables or rods, castering are free to swivel. In both cases the
airplane's steered by the rudder pedals.

**Tailwheel Landing Gear**

 * Allows better ground clearance for larger propellors.
 * More desirable on unimproved fields.
 * With CG behind the main landing gear, directional control is more difficult
   on the ground, with the CG trying to get in front of the main landing gear.
 * Has diminished forward visibility.

**Fixed and Rectractable Landing Gear**

 * Fixed: remains extended, simplicity and low maintenance/cost.
 * Retractable: streamlines the airplane by stowing inside the structure during
   cruise.

**Brakes**

 * Located on the main wheels, applied either by hand or foot controls (toe
   or heel).
 * Foot pedals operate independently and allow for differential braking, which
   can supplement steering on the ground.
