# Aerodynamic Forces in Flight Maneuvers

**Forces in Turns**

 * The force of lift during a turn is separated into a vertical component
   acting upward and opposing the force of weight, and a horizontal component
   pointing inward toward the turn and responsible for moving the airplane
   around the turn.
 * The horizontal component can also be called the **centripetal force**.
 * The rudder is used to correct any deviation between the straight track
   of the nose and tail of the aircraft around the turn.
    * If no rudder is used in the turn, the nose yaws to the outside of the
      turn, called **adverse yaw**.

 * Banking an aircraft doesn't result in any change in the amount of lift
   developed, but part of the lift that was opposing weight is now being
   used to turn the aircraft.
    * The result is the aircraft loses altitude unless additional lift
      is created, either by adding back pressure on the yoke or increasing
      engine power.
    * When the *vertical* component of lift is once again equal to the
      weight, the aircraft will stop losing altitude.

 * At a given airspeed, the rate of turn depends on the *horizontal*
   component of lift.
 * The horizontal component of lift is proportional to the angle of bank,
   ie. if you increase the bank angle then the rate of turn is increased
   and radius of the turn decreased.

**Slipping and Skidding turns**

 * In a **slipping** turn, the nose points to the **outside** of the turn.
 * In a **skidding** turn, the nose points to the **inside** of the turn.

**Rate of Turn (ROT) vs. Airspeed**

 * To maintain a *rate* of turn as airspeed increases, the angle of bank
   must be increased.
 * For example, at 400mph an aircraft must be banked approximately 44
   degrees to maintain a standard rate turn (3 degrees/second).

**Forces in Climbs**

 * The wing's lift in a steady state normal climb is the same as it is in
   steady level flight at the same airspeed.
 * There is an initial momentary change during the transition from straight-
   and-level flight to climb when back pressure is applied and a momentary
   increase in lift is created, by after the flight path is stabilized on
   the upward incline, AOA (remember, to the *relative* wind) and lift again
   revert to about the level flight values.

**Weight Acting as Drag**

 * When the flight path is inclined upward, a component of the aircraft's
   weight acts in the same direction as, and parallel to, the total drag.
 * Consequently, the total *effective* drag is greater than the power and
   the airspeed decreases (assuming no thrust has been added).
 * As airspeed decreases, drag also decreases until it once again equals
   thrust.
    * Generally the components of lift, weight, thrust, and drag once again
      stabilize, but at a lower airspeed value than in straight-and-level
      flight.
 * Therefore, an increase in thrust is required to maintain the same airspeed
   in a climb as in straight-and-level flight.

**Absolute Ceiling**

 * Note that aircraft are able to sustain a climb due to excess thrust.
 * When the excess thrust is gone, the aircraft is no longer able to climb.
 * At this point, the aircraft has reached its "absolute ceiling".

**Forces in Descents**

 * When the yoke is moved forward to initiate a descent, it results in an
   addition of lift of the elevator, moving the wing's leading edge
   downaward and resulting in a momentary decrease in the wing's AOA.
 * For this instant, the AOA decreases causing the total lift to decrease.
 * Weight weight now greater than lift, the aircraft begins to descend.
 * At the same time, the flight path goes from level flight to descending,
 * The component of weight acts forward along the flight path, which
   increases the airplane's airspeed. Therefore, if you want to descend
   at the same airspeed as in straight-and-level flight, a reduction in
   thrust is required.
