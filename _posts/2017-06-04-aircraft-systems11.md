# Oxygen Systems

 * FARs:
    * After 30 mins 12,500'-14,000': flight crews have and use supplemental O2.
    * Any time 14,000'-15,000': flight crews use supplemental O2.
    * Any time > 15,000': every occupant provided with supplemental O2.
 * Depending on a person's physical characteristics and condition, they might
   feel effects of oxygen deprivation much lower.
    * For this reason, flight crews are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen
      above 10,000' during the day, and above 5,000' at night.

Most high altitude aircraft are equipped with some kind of fixed oxygen
installation. Portable oxygen can be used if an installed one isn't available.
Portable equipment usually consists of a **container, regulator, maxk outlet, and
pressure guage.**

**Aircraft Oxygen Storage**

 * Aircraft oxygen is usually stored in high pressure containers of 1,800-2,200
   psi.
 * When the **ambient temperature** around a cylinder decreases, pressure in the
   container decreases (pressure varies with temperature if the volume of a gas
   remains constant.)
    * **A drop in oxygen pressure may be because of the container being stored
      in an unheated part of the aircraft rather than an actual depletion of
      the oxygen supply.**
 * Containers should be marked with the psi tolerance (eg. 1,800 psi) before
   filling the container to that pressure.
 * Containers should be filled with oxygen that meets or exceeds **SAE AS8010**,
   Aviator's Breathing Oxygen Purity Standard. Period inspection and servicing
   of oxygen systems is recommended.

**Oxygen Regulation with Altitude**

 * Regulators supply oxygen based on cabin altitude.
    * Most regulators approved up to **40,000'** are designed to provide...
       * 0% cylinder oxygen and 100% cabin air up to 8,000', with the ratio
         changing to...
       * 100% oxygen and 0% cabin air at approximately 34,000'.
    * Most regulators approved up to **45,000** are designed to provide...
       * 40% cylinder oxygen and 60% cabin air at lower altitudes, and...
       * 100% oxygen at higher altitudes.

**Fire Danger with Oxygen**

 * Materials that are normally fireproof in normal air may be susceptible to
   combustion in oxygen.
 * Oils and greases may ignite if exposed to oxygen, and cannot be used for
   sealing valves or fittings in the oxygen system.
 * **Smoking during any kind of oxygen equipment use is prohibited.**

# Oxygen Masks

 * There are numerous types and designs of oxygen masks. The most important
   factor is that the masks and oxygen system are compatible.
    * **Crew masks** are fitted to the face with minimum leakage, and usually
      contain a microphone. Most are **oronasal** - only cover mouth and nose.
    * **Passenger masks** may be a sumple cup-shaped rubber molding, allowing
      fit to different individuals. May have an elastic strap or be held on
      by hand.
 * All oxygen masks should be kept clean to reduce danger of infection and
   prolong life of the mask.
    * Can be cleaned with mild soap and water, and rinsed with clear water.
    * If the mask has a microphone, use a clean swab instead of running water
      to clean off the soapy solution.
    * Masks should also be **disinfected**, can use **Merthiolate in a water
      solution** (1/5 teaspoon to a quart of water).

# Cannula

 * Plastic tubing that runs under the nose to provide oxygen.
 * More comfortable than masks, but may not provide an adequate flow of oxygen
   as relaiably as masks at higher altitudes.
 * Older airplanes with installed oxygen used to use cannulas, but **current
   regulations require aircraft with oxygen systems installed and certified for
   operations above 18,000' to be equipped with oxygen masks instead of
   cannulas.**

# Diluter-Demand Oxygen Systems

 * Supply oxygen only when the wearer inhales through the mask.
 * An **automix lever** allows regulators to automatically mix cabin air and
   oxygen, or supply 100% oxygen depending on altitude.
 * Includes a tight seal to prevent dilution with outside air.
 * Can be used safely up to 40,000'.
 * Pilots with beards or mustache should be sure it's trimmed to prevent
   interference with the mask seal, and checked on the ground.

# Pressure-Demand Oxygen Systems

 * Similar to dilter-demand systems, except the oxygen is supplied under pressure
   above 34,000', allowing the user's lungs to be pressurized with oxygen.
 * This feature makes some pressure-demand systems safe above 40,000'.
 * Some systems have the regulator attached directly to the mask, others have
   it mounted on the instrument panel or other area in the flight deck.
    * **The mask-mounted regulator eliminates the problem of a long hose that
      must be purged of air before 100% oxygen begins flowing in the mask.**

# Continuous-Flow Oxygen System

 * Usually provided for passengers.
 * Typically has a **reservoir bag** that collects oxygen from the system when
   the user is exhaling.
    * Oxygen collected in the bag allows a higher aspiratory flow rate during
      inhalation, which reduces amount of air dilution.
 * Ambient air is added to the supplied oxygen during inhalation after the
   reservoir bag oxygen supply is depleted.
 * Exhaled air is released to the cabin.

# Electrical Pulse-Demand Oxygen System

 * Portable electrical pulse-demand oxygen systems deliver oxygen by detecting
   an individual's inhalation effort, and **provide oxygen during the initial
   portion of inhalation.**
 * These don't waste oxygen because it's only delivered during inhalation.
    * Compared to continous-flow, it can reduce the amount of oxygen used by
      50-85%.
 * Most also include an internal barometer to automatically compensate for
   changes in altitude by increasing oxygen as altitude increases.

# Pulse Oximeters

 * A device that measures oxygen in the blood, by measuring **color changes
   that red blood cells undergo when they become saturated by oxygen.**
    * They transmit a special light beam through a fingertip.
 * Also measure heart rate.
 * Allow crewmembers to evaluate their need for supplemental oxygen.
 * Can calculate oxygen saturation within 1% of directly measured blood cells.
 * Because of portability, useful for pilots in nonpressurized aircraft.

# Servicing Oxygen Systems

 * Should only be done outside hangars.
 * Oxygen under pressure creates spontaneous results when in contact with
   petroleum products, the person servicing should be careful to wash dirt, oil,
   grease (including lip balm and hair oil) from themselves before working around
   oxygen equipment.
