# Motion Sickness

 * Caused by the brain receiving conflicting messages about the state
   of the body, anxiety and stress can contribute.
 * Opening fresh air vents, focusing outside, and avoiding unecessary
   head movements may help.
 * Although some medications help, they're not recommended due to
   side effects such as drowsiness.

# CO Poisoning

 * CO is a colorless, odorless gas produced by all
   combustion engines.
 * It attaches to the hemoglobin in the blood about 200 times more
   easily than oxygen, and prevents hemoglobin carrying oxygen to the
   cells.
 * The body requires up to 48 hours to dispose of CO.
 * If severe enough, it can cause death.
 * Heater and defroster vents may provide a path for CO into the cabin.
   If a strong odor of exhaust gases is present, suspect CO as well,
   although dangerous amounts may be present even without any exhaust
   gas smell.
 * A small disposable CO detector changes color in the presence of
   CO.
 * Symptoms are:
    * Headache.
    * Blurred vision.
    * Dizziness.
    * Drowsiness.
    * Loss of muscle power.
 * If any of these symptoms are experienced, turn of the heater, open
   fresh air vents and windows, and use supplemental oxygen if available.

# Stress

 * The body responds to stress by releasing chemical hormons (eg.
   adrenaline) into the blood and increasing metabolism. Blood sugar,
   heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, and perspiration all increase.
 * The term 'stressor' describes something that causes an individual
   stress.
    * Examples: physical (noise or vibration), physiological (fatigue),
      psychological (difficult work or personal situations).
 * Falls into two broad categories:
    * **Acute (short term):** an immediate stress perceived as danger.
      Triggers a 'fight or flight' response'. Normally a healthy person
      can cope with acute stress. Ongoing actue stress may develop into
      chronic stress.
    * **Chronic (long term):** a level of stress that presents an
      intolerable burden. Ability to cope and performance fall rapidly.
      Examples: loneliness, financial/work/relationship issues.
      Pilots suffering from chronic stress should not exercise airman
      privileges.

# Fatigue

 * Frequently associated with pilot error.
 * Effects include degradation of attention and concentration, impaired
   coordination, decreased ability to communicate.
 * Results from sleep loss, exercise, or physical work.
 * Fatigue falls into the same categories as stress:
    * **Acute (short term):** normal occurrence in everyday living.
      Rest after exertion and 8 hours of sleep normally cures acute
      fatigue.
       * **Skill Fatigue** is a special type of acute fatigue. It has
         two main effects on performance:
          1. **Timing disruption:** appearing to perform a task as
             usual, but the timing of each component is slightly off.
          2. **Perceptual field disruption:** concentrating attention
             on movements in the center of vision and neglecting those
             on the periphery.
       * Causes of acute fatigue:
          * Mild hypoxia.
          * Physical stress.
          * Psychological stress.
          * Depelction of physical energy.
          * Sustained psychological stress.
    * **Chronic (long term):** usually has psychological roots, although
      can be caused by an underlying disease.
       * Cannot usually be cured by rest or diet, and usually requires
         seeing a physician.

# Exposure to Chemicals

 * During preflight a pilot deals with **hydraulic fluid, oil, and fuel.**
   It's important to recognise the potential hazards of working with
   these fluids.
 * It's important to be familiar with the **Material Safety Data Sheet**
   (MDSD) for each chemical type, but the items give a minimum
   guideline for first aid in each scenario.
 * In general avoid skin or eye contact, or ingestion. If these occur,
   flush or clean the affected areas, and seek medical attention if
   symptoms persist.

# Dehydration and Heatstroke

**Dehydration**

 * Critical loss of water from the body.
 * Can be caused by hot flight decks, wind, humidity, diuretic drinks.
 * Symptoms are fatigue, degradation of physical and mental performance,
   thirst, abdominal cramps.
 * Prevent dehydration by drinking enough water, and being aware of the
   effect of the above causes.

**Heatstroke**

 * Inability of the body to control its temperature.
 * May have symptoms similar to dehydration, but can be no symptoms
   prior to a complete collapse.
 * Prevention - carry water on long flights and drink regularly,
   adjusting for heat as required. If the aircraft has a canopy
   or roof window, wear light pourous clothing and a hat, and
   ventilate the flight deck to dissipate excessive heat.

# Alcohol

 * Even in small amounts, alcohol can impair judgement, decrease sense
   of responsibility, affect coordination, constrict visual field,
   diminish memory, reduce reasoning ability, and lower attention
   span.
 * Alcohol is a depressent, works on the body like an anesethetic.
 * While hungover, motor and mental response impairment is still
   present.
 * **Altitude multiplies the effect of alcohol on the brain.** When
   combined with altitude, 2 drinks may feel like 3 or 4.
 * **Alcohol interferes with the brain's ability to utilize oxygen,
   a form of histotoxic hypoxia.**

**Amounts**

 * 14 CFR Part 91 requires that blood alcohol level be **less than
   0.04%, and 8 hours pass between drinking alcohol and piloting
   an aircraft.**

# Drugs

 * The FARs include no specific references to medication usage. However,
   two regulations are important to consider:
    * **61.53** prohibits acting as PIC, or as a required flight
      crewmember while:
       1. Knows or has reason to know of any medical condition that
          would make the person unable to meet the requirements for
          the medical certificate necessary for the pilot operation,
          or
       2. Is taking medication or receiving other treatment for a
          medical condition that results in the person being unable
          to meet the requirements for the medical certificate
          necessary for the pilot operation.
    * **91.17** prohibits the use of any drug that affects the person's
      faculties in any way contrary to safety.
 * Many FDA approved medicines, and herbal and dietry supplements, have
   side effects. The FAA regularly reviews FDA and other data to
   check that medications found acceptable for aviation duties pose
   no other side effects.
 * It's important to remember that drugs with no noticeable side effects
   on the ground may have significant ones at altitude.
    * Any medication that depresses the nervous system makes a pilot
      more susceptible to hypoxia.

**Painkillers**

 * Grouped into two types:
    1. Analgesics, eg. apsrin - drugs that reduce pain and have few
       noticeable side effects, generally OK to fly with.
    2. Anasthetics, eg. Codeine - drugs that deaden pain or cause
       loss of consciousness. Almost always preclude flying.

 * **Stimulants** are drugs that excite the central nervous system.
    * May cause anxiety or mood swings, both of which are dangerous
      while flying.
 * **Depressants** are drugs that reduce the body's functioning, eg.
   lowreing blood pressure, slow motor and reaction times. Most
   common is alcohol.
 * Some drugs are classified as neither, eg. some antibiotics, but
   can still have dangerous side effects.

**IMSAFE with Medication**

 * For the medication component of IMSAFE, pilots should ask themselves
    * Am I taking anything that might affect my judgement or make
      me drowsy?
    * Am I taking any new medication? If so, wait 48 hours to determine
      you have no adverse side effects.
 * You should wait **at least five maximal dosing intervals** (the time
   between recommended or prescribed dosing) before flying after taking
   any medication with adverse side effects.

# Altitude-Induced Decompression Sickness (DCS)

 * Decompression Sickness (DCS) results from exposure to low pressures
   that cause intert gases (mainly nitrogen) that normally dissolve
   in body fluids and tissues, to come out of solution and form
   bubbles.
 * The most common system is **joint pain**, known as "the bends".
 * What to do when altitude-induced DCS occurs:
    * Put on an oxygen mask immediately and switch the regular to
      100% oxygen.
    * Begin an emergency descent and land as soon as possible.
    * If one of the symptoms is joint pain, **keep the area still.**
    * Upon landing, seek medical attention from a physician likely
      to be familiar with this type of problem (eg. AME, military
      flight surgeon).
 * Delayed signs of DCS can occur after return to ground level
   even if not present during flight.

**DCS After Scuba Diving**

 * Scuba diving subjects the body to increased pressure, which allows
   more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues and fluids.
 * The reduction in pressure in flying can cause physical problems
   for scuba divers.
 * **A pilot or passenger who intends to fly after scuba diving should
   allow the body sufficient time to rid itself excess absorved
   nitrogen.**
    * **The recommended waiting times are:**
       * At least 12 hours up to 8,000' for dives that *do not
         require a controlled ascent*.
       * At least 24 hours up to 8,000' for dives that *do
         require a controlled ascent*.
       * At least 24 hours for flights above 8,000'
    * These are actual flight altitudes, not taking into account
      cabin pressurization, in case of decompression of the aircraft
      during flight.
