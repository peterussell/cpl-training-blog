# Axes of an Aircraft

The axes are three imaginary lines which passs through an aircraft's CG
at 90 degree angles to each other:

 * Longitudinal
    * Passes through the CG and from nose to tail.
    * Movement about this is *roll*.
    * Controlled by *ailerons*.
 * Lateral:
    * Passes through the CG and through each wingtip.
    * Movement about this is *pitch*.
    * Controlled by *elevators*.
 * Vertical:
    * Passes through the CG and vertically through the top and bottom.
    * Movement about this is *yaw*.
    * Controlled by the *rudder*.

There are exceptions to the surfaces which control each movement, which
will be discussed in a later section "Flight Controls".

# Moment and Moment Arm

Physics shows that a body that is free to rotate will *always turn about its
CG*.

 > In aerodynamic terms, the mathematical measure of an aircraft's tendency
 > to rotate about its CG is called a "moment".

 > **A moment is equal to the product of the force applied and the distance
 > at which a force is applied.**

 * A **moment arm** is the distance from a datum [reference point or line] to
   the applied force.
 * For W&B calculations, mmoments are the distance of the arm times the
   aircraft's weight, and have a unit of inch-pounds.

# Aircraft Design and Moments

**Thrust**

If the thrust line is designed to pass horizontally through the CG, it
will not cause the aircraft to pitch when power is changed, and there
will be no difference in moment due to thrust for a power-on or
power-off condition of flight.

**Drag & Tail**

Although designers have some control over the location of drag forces, they
are not always able to make the resultant drag force pass through the CG
of the aircraft.

However, they have control over the size and location of the tail. The
objective is to make the moments (due to thrust, drag, and lift) as
small as possible and, by proper location of the tail, **provide means
of balancing an aircraft longitudinally for any condition of flight**.
