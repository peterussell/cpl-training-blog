# Load Factors and Stalling Speeds

 * Any aircraft, within the limits of its structure, may be stalled at any airspeed.
 * A study of this has revealed that **an aircraft's stalling speed *increases*
   in proportion to the square of the load factor.**
    * *Example: an aircraft with a normal unaccelerated stalling speed of 50kts can
      be stalled at 100kts by inducing a load factor of 4 Gs.*
    * *Example 2: if an aircraft produces a load factor of 3 at 72 degrees in a steep
      turn, then the stalling speed is increased significantly. In one case, if the
      unaccelerated stalling speed is 45kts, the airspeed must be kept greater than
      75kts in a 72 degree bank turn to avoid inducing a stall.*
 * A pilot should be aware of:
    1. The danger of inadvertently stalling the aircraft by increasing the load factor,
       for example in a steep turn or spiral.
    2. When inadvertently stalling above its design manuevering speed (Va), a
       tremendous load factor is imposed.
 * *NB. the book includes an example graph of stall speed vs. load factor*.

A simlar efect is experienced in a quick pull up (or any other maneuver producing
load factors greater than 1 G. This sudden, unexpected loss of control, particularly
in a steep turn or abrupt application of the back elevator control near the ground,
has caused many accidents.

Since the load factor is squared as the stall speed doubles, tremendous loads may
be imposed on structures by stalling at high airspeeds.

**Design Maneuvering Speed (Va)**

The maximum speed at which an airplane may be stalled safely is now determined for
all new designs. It's called the design maneuvering speed, or V<sub>A</sub>.

> It is the speed below which you can move a single flight control, one time, to
> its full deflection, for one axis of airplane rotation only (pitch, roll, yaw),
> in smooth air, without risk of damage to the airplane.

For older general aviation airplanes, this speed is **approximately 1.7 times the
normal stalling speed.**

 * *Example: for an older GA airplane with a stalling speed of 60kts, it should
   never be stalled at greater than 102kts (60kts x 1.7 = 102kts).*

**Measuring Load Factors in Flight**

Since the leverage in control systems varies with different aircraft (some types
employ 'balanced' control surfaces while others don't), the pressure exerted by
the pilot on the controls cannot be accepted as a way to determine the load factors.

It can be judged by an experienced pilot by the feel of seat pressure. Load
factors can also be measured by an 'accelerometer', but this isn't common in
general aviation airplanes.

A thorough knolwedge of load factors induced by varying degrees of bank and the
V<sub>A</sub> aids in the prevention of two of the most serious types of accidents:

 1. Stalls from steep turns or excessive maneuvering near the ground.
 2. Structural failures during acrobatics or other violent maneuvers resulting
    from loss of control.

# Load Factors and Flight Maneuvers

 * Critical load factors apply to all flight maneuvers excepted unaccelerated
   straight flight (load factor of 1 G).
 * The maneuvers discussed here are known to involve relatively high load factors.
 * Full application of pitch, roll, or yaw should be confined below V<sub>A</sub>.
 * Even below V<sub>A</sub>, avoid rapid and alternating large control inputs,
   these can still result in structural damage or failure below V<sub>A</sub>.

**Turns**

 * Increased load factors are part of all banked turns, as discussed earlier.
 * Load factors become significant beyond 45 degrees.
 * The yield factor of the average light plane is reached at a bank of
   approximately 70 to 75 degrees.
 * The stalling speed is **increased by half at a bank of approximately 63
   degrees.**

**Stalls**

 * The normal stall entered from unaccelerated flight or an unaccelerated
   straight climb don't increase beyond 1 G.
 * However, as the stall occurs, the load factor can decrease to near 0 G,
   ie. a weightless feeling.
 * As the controls are moved forward to break the stall, it can result in a
   negative load factor, a feeling of floating free in space.
 * During pull up and stall recovery, significant load factors are sometimes
   induced.
    * These may be increased inadvertently by diving excessively and having
      a high airspeed, and/or pulling up abruptly.
    * Either of these can result in a large load factor on the airplane, and
      can also result in secondary stalls.
 * In general, recovery from a stall should not exceed V<sub>A</sub> during
   the recovery. Recovery shouldn't exceed 2 - 2.5 Gs.

**Spins**

 * A stabilized spin is similar to a stall in everything except the rotation,
   and the same load factor considerations apply as above.
 * In spin recovery it's common to have a lower nose attitude, so the pilot
   needs to be aware of higher potential airspeeds and consequently higher
   load factors during recovery.
 * The load factor in a proper spin recovery usually is found to be about
   2.5 Gs.
 * The load factor *during* a spin varies with aircraft, but usually found to
   be slightly above 1 G, for two reasons:
    1. Airspeed in a spin is very low, usually within 2 knots of the
       unaccelerated stall speed.
    2. An aircraft pivots, rather than turns, while in a spin.

**High Speed Stalls**

 * The average light airplane is not built for these.
 * The only way to induce a stall at an airspeed higher than normal stalling
   speed involves adding a load factor, which can be accomplished by a severe
   pull on the elevator control.
 * A speed of 1.7 times stall speed produces a load factor of about 3 Gs.
 * This only involves a very narrow margin for error - for example, in an
   airplane with a normal stall speed of 60kts, a 3 G load factor would occur
   in a stall at 102kts, and a 4 G load factor at 112kts.

**Chandelles and Lazy Eights**

A **chandelle** is a maximum performance climbing turn beginning from
approximately straight and level flight, and ending at the completion of
a precise 180 degree turn in a wings-level, nose-high attitude at the
minimum controllable airspeed.

In a chandelle, the aircraft is in a steep climbing turn and almost stalls
to gain altitude while changing direction.

A **lazy eight** gets its name from the way the fuselage traces a flight
pattern in the shape of a figure 8 lying on its side.

In both of these maneuvers the load factors depend on the speed of the
dives and abruptness of the pull-ups during the maneuvers. In general,
the better the maneuver is performed, the less extreme the load factor.
A chandelle or lazy eight with a load factor of more than 2 Gs will not
result in a great a gain in altitude; in low-powered aircraft it may
result in a loss of altitude.

The smoothest pull-up possible, with a moderate load factor, delivers
the greatest gain in altitude in a chandelle, and results in a better
overall performance in both chandelles and lazy eights.

The recommended entry speeds for these maneuevers is generally near
V<sub>A</sub>, which allows maximum development of load factors without
exceeding the load limits.

# Rough Air

 * All standard certificate aircraft are designed to withstand loads imposed
   by gusts of considerable intensity.
 * Gust load factors increase with airspeed - the strenght used for design
   purposes is usually the highest flight speed.
 * In extremely rough air (eg. thunderstorms), it's wise to reduce airspeed
   below V<sub>A</sub>.
 * Regardless of airspeed, there may be gusts that produce loads which
   exceed the load limits.

**Types of Load Factors in Aircraft Design**

There are two types of load factors used in aircraft design: **limit load**,
and **ultimate load**.

 * Limit load: force applied to an aircraft that causes a bending of the
   structure that does not return to its original shape.
 * Ultimate load: load factor applied to the aircraft (beyond the limit load)
   at which the material experiences structural failure (breakage).

Load factors lower than the limit load factor can be sustained without
compromising the integrity of the aircraft structure.

> Speeds up to, but not exceeding, the maneuvering speed allow an aircraft
> to **stall prior to experiencing an increase in load factor that would
> exceed the limit load of the aircraft.**

# Vg Diagram

 * The flight operating strength is shown on a Vg diagram: velocity vs load
   factor. The vertical scale is load factor (or Gs), horizontal is velocity.
 * Each aircraft has its own Vg diagram, **valid at a certain weight and
   altitude**.
 * The lines of maximum lift capability (curved lines) show the minimum
   speed at a given load factor required, below which the airplane would stall.
 * The diagram also shows regions where structural damage, and structural
   failure would occur for a given load factor (positive or negative).
 * The **limit airspeed** (or redline speed) is a design reference point for
   the aircraft, above which structural damage or failure may result from
   a variety of phenomena.
 * For each Vg diagram, the aircraft in flight cannot exceed the limit
   (redline) speed, the limit load factor, or the maximum lift capability.
   The aircraft must be operated within this 'envelope' to prevent structural
   damage.
