# Basic Propellor Principles

 * Propellor blades are airfoils - when turned by the engine they produce
   lift in terms of thrust and either pull or push the airplane through the
   air.
 * **Blade angle**, usually measured in degrees, is the angle between the
   chord of the blade and the plane of rotation, *and is measured at a
   specific point along the length of the blade.*
 * Because most propellors have a flat blade "face", the chord line is
   often drawn along the face of the propellor blade.
 * Aerodynamically, thrust is the result of the propellor shape and the
   AOA of the blade.

**Pitch**

> The pitch is the distance in inches which the propellor would screw
> through the air in one revolution if there were no slippage.

 * A propellor designated as a "74-48" would be 74 inches in length, and
   have an effective pitch of 45 inches.

**Fixed Pitch Propellors**

When specifying a fixed-pitch propellor for an aircraft, it's usually
chosen to be a pitch that operates efficiently at the expected cruising
speed.

Every fixed-pitch propellor is a compromise because it can only be
efficient at one given combination of airspeed and RPM.

When the aircraft is on the ground with the engine moving slowly
(eg. taxi or beginning of takeoff), the propellor efficiency is very low
because the propellor is restrained from advancing with sufficient
speed to permit its fixed-pitch blades to reach their full efficiency.
**In this situation, each blade is producing relatively little thrust
compared to the power required to turn it.**

**Twisted Blades**

 * Each point along a propellor blade travels at a different speed to the
   other points - points nearer the tip travel fastest, points close to
   the hub travel slowest.
 * **Twisting the blade allows it to have a relatively constant AOA along
   its entire length.**

**Propellor AOA is the product of two motions: propellor rotation about
its axis, and its forward motion.**

**Constant-Speed Propellors**

A constant-speed propellor automatically keeps the blade angle adjusted
for maximum efficiency for most flight conditions:

 * At takeoff, when maximum power and thrust are required, the constant-
   speed propellor is at a low blade angle (pitch).
    * The low blade angle keeps the AOA small and efficient with respect
      to the relative wind.
    * It also imposes a smaller load on the engine per revolution,
      allowing the engine to operate at a higher RPM.
    * The high RPM also creates maximum thrust becase, although the mass
      of air handled per revolution is small, the RPM and slipstream
      velocity are high, and with low aircraft speed there is maximum
      thrust.
 * After takeoff as the airspeed increases, the constant-speed propellor
   automatically changes to a higher angle (or pitch).
    * The higher blade angle increases the mass of air handled per
      revolution, which decreases the engine RPM, reducing fuel
      consumption, engine wear, and keeps thrust at a maximum.
