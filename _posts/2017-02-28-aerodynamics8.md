# Stability - Longitudinal (Pitching)

Longitudinal stability is the quality that makes an aircraft stable about its
*lateral* axis. It involves the pitching moment as the aircraft's nose moves
up and down during flight.

A longitudinally *unstable* aircraft has a tendency to dive or climb progressively
into a very steep dive or climb, or even a stall. *An aircraft with longitudinal
instability becomes difficult and sometimes dangerous to fly.*

**Static longitudinal stability** is dependent on three things:

 1. Location of the wing with respect to the CG.
 2. Location of the horizontal tail surfaces with respect to the CG.
 3. Area or size of the tail surfaces.

*To obtain longitudinal stability* the relation of the wing and tail moments must
be such that:

 * If the moments are initially balanced and the aircraft is suddenly nose up, the
   wing and tail moments change so that the *sum* of their forces provides an
   unbalanced by restoring force to bring the nose down.
 * Similarly, if the nose is pitched down, the wing and tail moments change so that
   they provide a sum of forces which brings the nose back up.

**Center of Lift and AOA**

The CL in most asymmetric airfoils tends to move with a change in angle of attack:

 * The CL tends to move **forward** with an increase in AOA.
 * The CL tends to move **aft** with a decrease in AOA.

**Important:** the result of this is that when the AOA of an airfoild is increased,
the CL, by moving forward, tends to lift the leading edge even further. This
tendency gives the wing an inherent quality of instability.

*(Note: CL is also often known as the Center of Pressure (CP)).*

# Tail Configuration with CG, CL, and AOA

 * Most aircraft are designed so the CL is *aft* of the CG.
   * This means the aircraft is 'nose heavy' and requires there be a slight
     **downward** force on the horizontal stabilizer to counter the downward
     force of the nose and prevent the aircraft from continually pitching down.
   * Compensation for this nose heaviness is provided by setting the horizontal
     stabilizer at a slight negative AOA, providing a downard force to hold
     the tail down.
   * *Because the arm between the CG and the tail is much longer, the force
     at the tail only needs to be much smaller than the downard force provided
     by the heavy nose created by the CL behind the CG.*

**Wing Downwash and the Horizontal Stabilizer**

 * Downwash from the wings strikes the top of the stabilizer and provides another
   downward pressure - at a *certain speed* this is just enough to balance the
   lever (assuming no pilot trimming).
 * The **faster** the aircraft is flying, the **greater the downwash on the tail**.
 * *For aircraft with fixed-position horizontal stabilizers, the manufacturer
   sets the stabilizer at an angle that provides the **best stability during
   flight at the design cruising speed and power setting.**

**The process of longitudinal oscillations stabilizing**

 * If the aircraft's speed *decreases*, downwash over the wing decreases, and
   the downard force on the tail decreases.
 * This provides the nose heaviness, the AOA of the wing decreases, and the
   airplane pitches nose down
 * As the airplane pitches down, it gains speed. This additional speed provides
   more downwash on the tail and results in an increase in wing AOA.
 * This increase in AOA is less steep than originally, and the aircraft starts
   to climb, but at a reduced rate than before.
 * This diminishing oscillations continue until they reach a place where the
   airspeed provides exactly the right amount of downwash on the tail to counter
   the downard pitching moment of the nose. At this point the airplane continues
   in stabilized flight unless the attitude and airspeed are changed.

**How to determine an airplane's longitudinal stability**

Trim the aircraft for 'hands off' control in level flight, then momentarily give
the controls a push to nose the aircraft down.

If, within a brief period, the nose rises toward the original position, the
aircraft is longitudinally stable. Ordinarily the nose passes the original
position and a series of small oscillations occur until the aircraft stabilizes.

If the oscillations gradually cease the aircraft has **positive stability**. If
the oscillations continue unevenly, the aircraft has **neutral stability**. If
they increase, it has **negative stability**.


# **Study Questions:**

 * **What are the three factors affecting longitudinal stability?**
    1. Location of the wing relative to the CG.
    2. Location of the horizontal tail surfaces with respect to the CG.
    3. Area or size of the tail surfaces.
 * **What is the characteristic of a longitudinally stable aircraft?**
    * The moments of the wing and tail are such that if the nose pitches up, the
      resulting moments of wing and tail sum to an unbalanced restoring force
      which brings the nose back down.
    * Similarly, if the nose pitches down, the wing and tail moments change to
      provide a sum which is unbalanced and works to bring the nose back up.
 * **What generally happens to the CL when the AOA is changed for an asymmetric airfoil?**
    * When the AOA is *increased* the CL moves forward.
    * When the AOA is *decreased* the CL moves aft.
 * **What does this mean for the stability of an asymmetric airfoil?**
    * When the AOA is increased, because the CL moves forward it tends to want to lift
      the leading edge of the airfoil, meaning the airfoil is inherently unstable.
 * **Where is the CL positioned relative to the CG on most airplanes?**
    * The CL is usually aft of the CG.
 * **Describe the general AOA of the horizontal stabilizer.**
    * The horizontal stabilizer generally has a negative AOA, providing a *downard*
      force to counter the downward force resulting from the CG being forward of
      the CG.
