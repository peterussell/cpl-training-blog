# Induction Systems

 * Induction systems bring air in from outside, mixes it with fuel, and delivers
   the fuel-air mixture to the cylinder where combustion occurs.
 * Outside air enters through a filtered intake on the front of the engine. Since
   the filter occasionally becomes clogged, an alternate source of air must be
   available. Usually it comes from *inside the engine cowling*, and may be
   activated automatically or manually.
 * Two types of induction systems are commonly used in small aircraft engines:
    * **Carburetor:** mixes fuel and air in the carburetor before the mixture
      enters the intake manifold.
    * **Fuel Injected:** mixes fuel and air immediately before entering the
      cylinder, or injects fuel directly into the cylinder.

# Carburetor Systems

 * Come in two categories:
    * **Float-type carbs** (most common).
    * **Pressure-type carbs** (not usually found on small aircraft).
 * The basic difference is fuel delivery: the pressure-type carb delivers
   fuel under pressure by a fuel pump.

**Float-Type Carburetor System**

 * Outside air flows through an air filter, usually located at an air intake in
   the front part of the engine cowling.
 * Filtered air flows into the carburetor and through a venturi (narrow throat
   in the carburetor).
 * As air flows through the venturi a low pressure area is created which forces
   fuel to flow through a main fuel jet located at the throat.
 * Fuel then flows into the airstream where it's vaporized and mixed with the air.
 * Fuel-air mixture is drawn into the *intake manifold* and into the combustion
   chambers where it's ignited.

The float-type carburetor gets its name from a float that rests on fuel in the
float chamber. A needle attached to the float opens and closes the opening at
the bottom of the carburetor bowl. When the level gets low the float drops, opens
the opening and allows more fuel in. As the level rises the float rises and
closes the opening, shutting of the fuel intake to the float chamber.

The flow of fuel-air mixture to the *combustion chambers* is regulated by the
**throttle valve**, controlled by the throttle in the flight deck.

**Disadvantages**

 * Do not function well during abrupt maneuvers.
 * Discharge of fuel at low pressure leads to incomplete vaporization and
   difficulty in discharging fuel into some types of supercharged systems.
 * **Main disadvantage** is its icing tendency. Since the float-type carb must
   discharge fuel at a point of low pressure, the discharge nozzle must be
   located at the venturi throat, and the throttle valve (butterfly valve) must
   be between the fuel discharge nozzle and the engine.
    * This means the *drop in temperature due to fuel vaporization* takes
      place within the venturi.
    * As a result, **ice readily forms in the venturi and on the throttle valve.**
 * A **pressure-type carburetor** discharges fuel into the airstream at a pressure
   well above atmosopheric pressure. This results in **better vaporization** and
   permits the discharge to be on the engine side of of the throttle valve.
    * This means the discharge/vaporization takes place *after* the throttle
      valve, and drop in temp from vaporization is offset by heat from the engine.
    * Therefore, **the effect of vaporization icing is practically eliminated
      in a pressure-type engine**.
    * The effects of *rapid maneuvers are negligible on pressure-type carbs*,
      since their fuel chambers remain full in all conditions.

# Mixture Control

 * Carburetors are normally calibrated for a correct fuel-air mixture at
   sea-level pressure with the mixture full rich.
 * As altitude increases, air density entering the carb decreases while the
   amount of fuel remains the same, creating a progressively richer mixture which
   can result in **engine roughness** and **loss in power**.
    * Engine roughness is normally due to spark plug fouling, from excessive
      carbon buildup on the plugs.
    * **Carbon buildup** occurs because the rich mixture lowers the temperature
      inside the cylinder, inhibiting complete combustion of the fuel.
 * To maintain correct fuel-air mixture, the mixture must be leaned using the
   mixture control.
 * During descent from a high altitude, the mixture must be enriched or it may
   become too lean.
    * An overly lean engine causes **detonation**, which may result in **rough
      engine operation, overheating, and/or a loss of power.**
 * The best way to maintain proper fuel-air mixture is to **monitor the engine
   temperature and enrich mixture as needed**.
 * For **fuel-injected** engines, better fuel-economy can be achieved by using
   an exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauge.

# Carburetor Icing

 * Carb ice occurs due to the effect of fuel vaporization and decrease in air
   pressure in the venturi, which causes a sharp temperature drop in the carb.
 * If water vaport in the air condenses when carb temp is at or below freezing,
   ice may form on the carb throat and/or throttle valve. This ice can restrict flow of fuel-air mixture and reduce power.
 * **Carb ice is most likely to occur when temps are below 70 deg F (21
   deg C), and the relative humidity is above 80%.**
    * However, ir can occur even in outside air temps as high as 100 deg F (38
      deg C), and humidity as low as 50%.
    * The temperature drop can be as much as 70 deg F.
 * The first indication of carb ice in an airplane with a fixed-pitch prop is
   a decrease in RPM, followed by engine roughness.
 * In an airplane with a constant-speed prop, it's usually indicated by a
   **manifold pressure decrease but no decrease in RPM** (prop pitch is
   automatically adjusted to compensate for loss of power).
 * Although carb ice can occur during any phase of flight, it's particularly
   dangerous when using reduced power during a descent, where it could go
   unnoticed until power is added.
 * To combat carb ice, float type engines have a **carburetor heat system**.

# Carburetor Heat

 * Carb heat is an anti-icing system which preheats air before it reaches the
   carb, intended to keep the fuel-air mixture above freezing and prevent
   formation of ice in the carb throat.
 * It can be used to melt ice already formed if it's not too much, but it's better
   used as a preventative measure.
 * Additionally, **carb heat can be used as an alternate air source if the
   intake filter clogs, such as in sudden or unexpected airframe icing
   conditions**.
 * Carb heat should be used during descents in the *full on* position.
   Additionally, open the throttle periodically for a few seconds to keep the
   engine warm, otherwise the carb heater may not provide enough heat to
   prevent icing.

**Expected Engine Performance When Using Carb Heat**

 * Expect a decrease in power due to the less dense (heated) air, followed by
   a gradual increase in RPM as the ice melts.
 * The engine should also run more smoothly after the ice melts.
 * If ice is *not present*, RPM decreases then remains constant.
 * On an engine with a constant speed propellor, expect the same indications
   on the manifold pressure gauge rather than the tachometer.
 * **Carburetor heat must remain in the full hot position until normal power
   returns.**
 * Since carb heat tends to reduce output of the engine and increase operating
   temps, it should not be used when full power is required (eg. takeoff) or
   during normal engine operation except for testing, or detecting/preventing/
   removing carb ice.
