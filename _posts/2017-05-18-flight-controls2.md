# T-Tail

 * In a T-tail configuration, the elevator is above most of the effects
   of downwash from the propellor, as well as airflow around the fuselage
   and/or wings during normal flight.
 * **Operation of the elevators in this undisturbed air allows control
   movements that are consistent throughout most flight regimes.**
 * They're popular on aircraft with **rear mounted engines** to keep the
   elevator out of the exhaust blast.
 * They're popular on **seaplanes and amphibians** to keep the horizontal
   surfaces as far from the water as possible.
 * A T-tail requires more elevator deflection to *raise* the nose at slower
   speeds, because in a conventional configuration the propellor downwash
   helps push the tail down. It's important for a pilot to know that greater
   control forces are required to raise the nose at slow speeds.

**T-Tail and Flutter**

 * Since the *weight of the horizontal surfaces* is at the top of the
   vertical stabilizer, the moment arm causes high loads on the vertical
   stabilizer that can result in flutter.
 * Engineers must compensate by stiffening the vertical stabilizer,
   meaning T-tail aircraft are usually heavier.

**Deep Stalls with T-Tails**

 * When flying at a very high AOA, low airspeed, and aft CG, a T-Tail
   may be more susceptible to a 'deep stall', where the wake of the
   airflow over the stalled wing interferes with the air over the
   elevator, making it less effective or ineffective.
 * This can make it difficult or impossible to recover from a stall.
 * **Aft CG is often a contributing factor in these incidents.**
 * This can happen in conventional tailed aircraft, but is more likely
   with a T-tail since this configuration is more likely to place the
   horizontal stabilizer in the path of the airflow from the wing.
 * Additionally, the distance between wings and tail, and position of
   engines (eg. tail mounted) may increase the susceptibility of deep
   stalls, *therefore a deep stall may be more prevalent on transport
   vs. GA aircraft*.

**Elevator Authority and Landing**

 * The elevator must have sufficient authority to hold the nose of the
   aircraft up during the landing rollout. In this case, forward CG
   may cause a problem.
 * During the landing flare airspeed is low which decreases airflow
   over the empennage making the elevator less effective. This coupled
   with a CG too far forward can be dangerous.

# Stabilators

 * Stabilators are one-piece horizontal stabilizer and elevator that
   pivots from a central hinge point.
 * Because stabilators pivot around a central hinge point, they're
   extremely sensitive to control inputs and aerodynamic loads. For
   this reason they have an **antiservo tab**.
 * Antiservo tabs deflect *in the same direction as the stabilator*.
    * This results in an increas in force required to move the
      stabilator.
    * eg. pitch nose down, stabilator moves down (lifts the tail up),
      the antiservo tab moves down (lifts the *stabilator* up), which
      making it harder to deflect the stabilator downward.
 * In addition, a balance weight is usually incorporated in front of
   the main spar.

# Carnard

 * The carnard is a horizontal stabilizer in front of the main wings.
   It creates lift and holds the nose up.
 * There are two types: one where the forward horizontal stabilizer
   is roughly the same size as the rear horizontal stabilizer, and
   one where the forward stabilizer is roughly the same size as the
   wing (called a **tandem wing** configuration).
 * In theory this should also be more efficient since the extra
   horizontal surface helps lift the weight and should result in less
   drag for a given amount of lift.

# Rudder

 * Rudder controls movement about the vertical axis, called yaw.
 * It's a moveable surface hinged to the vertical stabilizer.
 * When the rudder is deflected *into the airflow, the tail yaws
   in the opposite direction.*
 * Rudder effectiveness increases with speed, and in propellor
   aircraft, any slipstream over the rudder increases its
   effectiveness.

# V-Tail

 * The V-configured surfaces on a V-Tail design act as both horizontal
   and vertical stabilizers.
 * The moveable surfaces, usually called **ruddervators**, are connected
   through a special linkage which allows the control wheel to move both
   surfaces **simultaneously**.
    * On the other hand, movement of rudder pedals moves the surfaces
      **differentially**.
 * When both rudder and elevator controls are moved, a **control mixing
   mechanism** moves each surface appropriately.
 * V-Tail designs are more susceptible to Dutch roll tendencies, and a
   total reduction in drag is minimal.
