# Wingtip Vortices

Recall that high pressure air below the wing attempts to move to low pressure
above the wing. The path of least resistance is toward the airfoil's tips,
resulting in a spanwise movement of the air outward from the fuselage around the
tips. This flow results in spillage over the tips, setting up a vortex. These
vortices increase drag because of energy spent in producing the turbulence.

Just as lift increases at higher AOA, so does induced drag. This is beacuse the
AOA is increases, increasing the pressure differential between the upper and
lower surfaces, and greater lateral airflow. Consequently this causes more
violent wingtip vortices to be set up, resulting in more turbulence and more
induced drag.

# Wake Turbulence

 * Wingtip vortices are greatest when the airplane is **heavy, clean, and slow**.
 * To minimize the chances of flying through an aircraft's wake turbulence:
    * Avoid flying through another aircraft's flight path.
    * Rotate prior to the point which the preceeding aircraft rotated at.
    * Avoid following an aircraft with a similar flight path at an altitude
      within 1,000'.
    * Approach and land beyond the landing point of the preceeding aircraft's
      touchdown point.

**Helicopter Turbulence**

 * A hovering helicopter generates a downwash from its main rotor(s) similar to
   an airplane.
 * Pilots of small aircraft should **avoid the area by three disc diameters.**
 * In flight, the vortices transform into a pair of strong, high-speed trailing
   vortices similar to wing-tip vortices of larger fixed-wing aircraft.
    * **Helicopter vortices should be avoided because helicopter forward flight
      speeds are often slow and generate exceptionally strong wake turbulence.**

**Wind**

Wind is an important factor in avoiding wake turbulence, because vortices drift
with the wind at the speed of the wind. When following another aircraft, a pilot
should consider wind speed and direction when selecting an intended takeoff or
landing point. As a rule of thumb, **approximately 3 minutes provides a margin
of safety to allow wake turbulence dissipation.**

# **Study Questions:**

 * **What phases of flight are wingtip vortices the strongest?**
    * During takeoff, climb, and landing.
 * **Where should you avoid flying to avoid another aircraft's wake turbulence?**
    * Through its flight path, rotate prior to its rotate point, land beyond
      its touchdown point, and avoid flying in the same flight path within 1,000'.
 * **What distance should pilots of small aircraft keep from hovering helicopters?**
    * Three rotor disc diameters.
