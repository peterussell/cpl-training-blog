# Visual Illusions

Two illusions that lead to spatial disorientation affect the eyes only:
false horizon, and autokinesis.

**False Horizon**

 * Can be caused by:
    * Sloping cloud formation.
    * Obscured horizon.
    * Aurora borealis.
    * Dark night with stars and ground lights spread out.
    * Certain patterns of ground lights.

**Autokinesis**

 * A stationary light may appear to move when stared at for a long time
   in the dark.
 * Pilot may attempt to align the aircraft with the perceived moving
   light.

# Postural Considerations

 * Postural system sends signals from skin, joints, muscles, to the
   brain, which are interpreted with relation to the Earth's
   gravitational pull.
 * Seat of the pants flying is largely dependent on this.
 * Many false sensations can occur due to acceleration forces
   overpowering gravity, eg. uncoordinated turns, climbing turns,
   turbulence.

**Coping with Spatial Disorientation**

 1. Understand the causes of the illusions and be alert for them.
 2. Obtain and understand preflight weather briefings.
 3. Before flying in marginal visibility, or when a horizon isn't
    available, obtain training and maintain instrument proficiency.
 4. Do not fly into adverse weather or dusk or darkness unless
    instrument proficient.
 5. When using outside visual references, make sure they are reliable,
    fixed points on the Earth's surface.
 6. Avoid sudden head movement, especially during takeoffs, turns, and
    approaches.
 7. Be physically fit for flight into reduced visibility, be well
    rested, fed, etc.
 8. Become proficient in flying on instruments.

# Optical Illusions

Various terrain features and atmospheric conditions can create optical
illusions, primarily associated with landing, especially when
transitioning from instrument flying to outside visual references.

**Runway Width Illusion**

 * A narrower than usual runway can create the illusion the aircraft is
   higher than actual, resulting in flying a lower approach.
 * A wider than usual runway makes it seem you're lower than actual,
   resulting in flying a higher approach.

**Runway Slope Illusion**

 * An upsloping runway can create the illusion that the aircraft is
   higher than actual, resulting in a lower approach.
 * Downsloping runways seem like you're lower than actual, resulting
   in an approach that's too high.

**Featureless Terrain Illusion**

 * An absence of ground features, eg. approach over water, darkened
   areas, or snow, can create the illusion the aircraft is higher than
   it actually is.

**Water Refraction**

 * Rain on the windscreen can create an illusion of being at a higher
   altitude, due to the horizon appearing lower than it is. Results
   in flying a lower approach.

**Haze**

 * Can create the illusion of being further and higher from the
   runway than actual, resulting in a low approach.
 * Conversely, extremely clear air can create the illusion that the
   runway is closer than it actually is, resulting in a high approach.

**Fog**

 * Flying into fog can create the illusion of pitching up.
 * Pilots who don't recognize this illusion often pitch down and
   steepen the approach abruptly.

**Ground Lighting Illusions**

 * Lights along a straight path, eg. road or trains, can be mistaken
   for runway and approach lights, especially where few lights are
   in the surrounding terrain.

# How To Prevent Landing Errors

 1. Anticipate the possibility of visual illusions, especially at
    unfamiliar airports, at night, and in adverse weather.
 2. Frequently refer to the altimeter.
 3. If possible, overfly unfamiliar airports before landing.
 4. Use VASI and PAPI, or electric glideslope when available.
 5. Use the VDP on many nonprecision approaches.
 6. Recognize that a high workload, eg. emergencies, increase the
    chance of these errors having an impact.
 7. Frequently practice landings and stay proficient in different
    landing scenarios.
