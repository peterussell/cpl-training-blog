# Pitot-Static Instruments

 * Uses static (static port) and dynamic (pitot-tube) forces to power the
   airspeed indicator (ASI), alitmeter, and vertical-speed indicator (VSI).

**Impact Pressure Chamber and Lines**

 * Dynamic pressure is present only when an aircraft is in motion, therefore
   it can be thought of as a pressure due to motion.
    * Wind also generates dynamic pressure.
    * If the aircraft is doing 70kts in still air, or is still in a 70kt
      wind, the same dynamic pressure is generated.
 * The **pitot tube** captures dynamic pressure, as well as static pressure.
 * In addition to the large hole in the front, there is a smaller hole in
   the back of the chamber allowing moisture to drain from the tube.
 * The ASI is the only instrument using the pitot tube, the VSI and altimeter
   both only use the static port.

**Static Pressure Chamber and Lines**

 * The static chamber is vented through small holes to the free undisturbed
   air on the side(s) of the aircraft.
 * As atmospheric pressure changes, air moves freely in and out of the holes,
   through the lines, and into the instruments.
 * An alternate static source exists on some aircraft to provide a backup.
    * This is normally found inside the flight deck.
    * Breaking the glass on an instrument (VSI recommended as less essential
      than ASI or altimeter) can also act as an alternate static source
    * **Due to the venturi effect of air flowing around the fuselage, air
      pressure inside the flight deck is lower than the exterior pressure.**
 * When alternate static is used:
    * Altimeter reads slightly higher than usual.
    * VSI intially shows a climb, then stabilizes.
    * ASI shows a speed slightly faster than usual.

# Altimeter

 * Measures height of an aircraft above a given pressure level.
 * Consists of a static of aneroid wafers, with an internal pressure
   calibrated of 29.92"Hg (unless changed by the altimeter setting), and is
   free to expand or contract with changes in static pressure.
    * Higher static pressure (lower altitude) squeezes the wafers,
      them, and resulting in an increase in altitude indication.
    * Lower static pressure expands the capsule, shows decrease in altitude.
 * Adjustments for non-standard pressures are made by setting the correct
   pressure on the altimeter, in the Kollsman window - only once this is
   set does the altimeter indicate the correct altitude above sea level.

**Effect of Nonstandard Pressure and Temperature**

 * Pressure and temperature can change between takeoff and landing, even
   on a local flight. If these aren't taken into consideration, flight
   can become dangerous.
    * For example, without changing the altimeter setting, in flight from
      a high pressure area to a low pressure area the altimeter would
      indicate a constant altitude. However, the lower pressure means the
      altimeter capsule expands, indicating a higher pressure than the
      airplane is actually at (ie. the airplane is *lower* than indicated).
    * **High to low, look out below**
 * In flight, it's important to obtain a current altimeter setting en route
   to ensure terrain and obstruction clearance.
 * Many altimeters can't be adjusted beyond 31.00"Hg or below 28.00"Hg.
   In the former, the aircraft altitude is higher than the altimeter
   indicates. In the latter, it's lower than indicated and **flight is not
   recommended.**
 * **Temperature:** cold air is denser than warm air.
    * When operating in temperatures colder than standard, **altitude will
      be lower than indicated.** (high (temp) to low, look out below).

**Setting the Altimeter**

 * Altimeter settings are accurate only in the vicinity of the station.
 * ATC will advise when update settings are available, or if flying without
   ATC the settings can be gained from nearby weather stations (ASOS/AWOS/
   ATIS).
 * When the **actual pressure is lower than what's set in the altimeter
   window**, the actual alititude is lower than indicated.

# Types of Altitude

 * **Indicated:** read directly from the altimeter (uncorrected), when set
   to the current altimeter setting.
 * **True (MSL):** vertical distance of the aircraft above sea level.
 * **Absolute (AGL):** vertical distance above ground level.
 * **Pressure Altitude:** altitude indicated when altimeter set to 29.92"Hg.
 * **Density Altitude:** pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard
   temperature and pressure. Altitude the airplane 'thinks' it's flying at.

**Air Density**

Density of air affects:

 * How much power a naturally aspirated engine produces.
 * How efficient the airfoils (wings and prop(s)) are.

Less dense air results in a longer takeoff roll, and a decrease in performance.

**Instrument Check**

Prior to each flight, set the altimeter setting to the current reported
setting, and verify it shows within 95' of the surveyed field elevation.
