# Airframe Systems

Airframe systems are fuel, electrical, hydraulic, and oxygen.

# Fuel Systems

Fuel systems come in two common classifications:

**Gravity-Feed System**

 * Uses force of gravity to feed fuel from tanks to engine.
 * Often used on high-wing airframes.

**Fuel-Pump System**

 * Used when gravity can't get fuel from the tanks to engine.
 * Often on low-wing airframes.
 * Uses two fuel pumps:
    * Main pump: engine driven.
    * Aux pump: electrically driven, used for startup and engine pump failure.
      Also known as a **boost pump**, provides added reliability.

**Fuel Primer**

 * Used on both gravity and pump systems.
 * Used to draw fuel from the tanks to vaporize fuel **directly into the
   cylinders** prior to starting.
 * Especially useful in cold weather because there isn't enough heat to
   vaporize fuel in the carb.
 * **It's important to lock the primer in place when not in use**. If it
   gets loose it can cause an excessively rich mixture.

** Fuel Tanks**

 * Normally located in the wings.
 * Filled through the filler opening, covered by a cap.
 * Vented to the outside to maintain atmospheric pressure inside the tank,
   may be vented through the cap or a separate tube.
 * Also include an **overflow drain**, allowing fuel to expand with increases
   in temperature.

**Fuel Drains**

 * Fuel gauges show the reading of a sensor, but are **only required to be
   accurate when reading "empty."** Any other amount should be verified.

**Fuel Pressure Gauge**

 * If a fuel pump is installed, a fuel pressure gauge is included.
   Indicates pressure in the fuel lines, normal pressure found in AFM/POH.

**Fuel Selectors**

 * Allows selection of fuel from various tanks. Commonly: LEFT, RIGHT,
   BOTH, OFF.
 * Placards show any limitations, eg. "level flight only".
 * **Running for prolonged periods with a fuel tank dry** may not only
   cause the engine to stop, but **may allow air to enter the fuel
   system, causing vapor lock**, making it difficult to restart the
   engine. On fuel-injected engines, the fuel becomes so hot it
   vaporizes in the fuel line, not allowing fuel to reach the cylinders.

**Fuel Strainers, Sumps, Drains**

 * After leaving the tank and before the carb, fuel passes through a
   strainer that removes any moisture and sediment.
    * Since these sediments are heavier than fuel, they settle in a
      sump (low point in a fuel system) at the bottom of the strainer.
 * Strainers should be drained before each flight, and checked for
   contaminants and water.
 * Water in the sump is hazardous because in cold weather it can
   freeze and block fuel lines. In *warm* weather it can flow into the
   carb and stop the engine.

**Fuel Grades**

 * Aviation Gasoline (AVGAS) is identified by an octane or performance
   number (grade), which **designates the antiknock value, or knock
   resistance of the fuel mixture in the engine cylinder.**
    * **The higher the grade, the more pressure the fuel can withstand
      without detonating**.
 * Lower grades of fuel are used in lower compression engines. Higher grades
   are used in higher compression engines.
 * **If the correct grade of fuel isn't available, use the *next highest*
   grade as a substitute. Never use a lower grade than recommended.**
    * This can cause the CHT and oil temp to exceed normal operating
      ranges, and may result in detonation.
 * Fuel for reciprocating engines is AVGAS 80, 100, and 100LL (low lead).
 * Fuel for turbine aircraft is JET A, JET A-1, and JET B.
    * Jet fuel is basically kerosene and has a distinct kerosene smell.
 * AVGAS is identified by **white letters on a red background**, turbine
   fuels are identified by **white letters on a black background**.
 * **100VLL** is approved for aircraft engines, and is basically
   identical to 100LL, except lead is reduced by about 19%.
    * 100VLL is blue like 100LL and virtually indistinguishable.

**Fuel Contamination**

 * Fuel should be drained from the fuel strainer quick drain from each
   tank, and sumped into a transparent container, then checked for dirt
   and water.
 * If water or contaminants are found, keep draining until removed.
 * Water shows as cloudy droplets in the fuel, or a clear separation
   between fuel and water. Water settles to the bottom (is heavier than
   aviation fuel).
 * Fuel tanks should be filled after each flight, or after the last flight
   of the day to prevent moisture condensation within the tank.

**Fuel System Icing**

 * Ice formation results from the presence of water in the fuel system.
 * This water may be dissolved or undissolved:
    * Dissolved: entrained water that consists of minute water particles
      suspended in the fuel. May occur as a result of mechanical
      agitation of free water, or conversion of dissolved water through
      temperature reduction.
       * Entrained water settles over time under static conditions, and
         may or may not be drained during servicing, depending on the
         rate it's converted to free water. In general, it's not likely
         that all entrained water can be separated from fuel under field
         conditions.
       * Droplets are usually small enough to be invisible to the naked
         eye, but may result in a haziness in the fuel.
       * Water in solution cannot be removed except by dehydration or
         converting it through temperature reduction entrained, then
         free water.
    * Undissolved: free water that may be introduced as a result of
      refueling or settling of entrained water. Free water is usually
      present in detectable quantities at the bottom of the tank, and
      can be drained through sump drains.
       * If free water freezes, sumps may become useless, but can later
         melt, releasing water into the system and causing engine
         malfuction or stoppage.
       * If frozen water is detected, warm the aircraft (eg. in a hanger)
         and re-drain when melted.
 * Water in suspension may freeze and form ice crystals sufficiently big
   to block fuel screens, strainers, and filters.
    * This water may be further cooled as the fuel enters the carb air
      passage, and cause carb icing.

**Prevention Procedures**

 * Use of approved anti-icing additives.
 * Use of **hexylene glycol**, certain **methanol derivatives**, and
   **ethylene glycol mononethyl ether (EGME) in small concentrations can
   inhibit fuel system icing.
    * Tests show EGME at max of **0.15%** by volume concetration
      substantially inhibits fuel system icing under most operating
      conditions.
 * **The concentration of addivites in fuel is critical.** Too little
   or too much shows a marked deterioration in additive effectiveness.
 * Fuel system additives are no replacement for carb heat.

# Refueling Procedures

 * **Static electricity** is formed by friction of air passing over the
   aircraft surfaces in flight, and by fuel passing through the hose.
 * Nylon, Dacron, or wool clothing is especially prone to accumulating
   and discharging static electricity from the person to the funnel or
   nozzle.
 * To guard against static electricity igniting fuel flames, a ground
   wire should be attached to the aircraft **before the cap is removed
   from the tank.**
 * Because the aircraft and refueler have different static charges,
   bonding both to each other is critical. By doing this, the static
   differential charge is equalized.
    * The refueling nozzle should be bonded to the aircraft before
      refueling begins, and remain bonded through the refuel process.A
 * When a fuel truck is used, it should be grounded before the fuel
   nozzle touches the aircraft.

**Refueling from Drums**

Proper bonding and grounding connections are important. Follow this order:

 1. Drum to ground.
 2. Ground to aircraft.
 3. Drum to aircraft or nozzle to aircraft before removing fuel cap.

When disconnecting, reverse the order.

Passage of fuel through a chamois increases the charge of static electricity
and danger of sparks. The aircraft must be properly grounded, and nozzle,
chamois filter, and funnel bonded to the aircraft.

**Under no circumstances should a plastic bucket or similar nonconductive
container be used in this operation.**

# Heating System

**Fuel Fired Heaters**

 * A small mounted or portable space heating device, where fuel is brought
   to the theater by piping from a fuel tank, or tapping into the aircraft's
   fuel system.
 * Fan blows air into a combustion chamber, and a spark plug ignites the
   fuel-air mixture.
 * Built in safety switch prevents fuel from flowing without the fan blowing.
 * **Outside the combustion chamber**, a second larger diameter tube
   moves air over the combustion chamber outer surface, and a second
   fan blows it to the interior of the aircraft.
 * Most gasoline heaters are between 5,000-50,000 BTUs (British Thermal
   Units).
 * **Requires electricity** to operate (from 12-volt or 24-volt airplane
   electrical system.
 * Requires routine maintenance & inspection, and replacement of igniter
   at regular intervals.
 * Because they're required to be vented (exhaust), it's important they
   don't leak into the aircraft.
 * An improperly adjusted or poorly maintained fuel heater can be
   dangerous.

**Exhaust Heating Systems**

Covered earlier.

**Combustion Heating Systems**

 * Often used in larger aircraft.
 * Burns aircraft's fuel in a combustion chamber, and air flowing around
   the tube is heated and ducted to the cabin.
 * When heater control switch is on, airflow, ignition, and fuel are
   supplied to the heater.
    * Airflow and ignition **are constant** while the heater control
      switch is on.
 * When heat is required, the thermostat is advanced (which senses
   ventilation air temp) and turns on the fuel solenoid, allowing fuel
   to spray into the burner chamber.
 * Carbon monoxide is a by-product, leaves via the heater exhaust.
 * As the thermostat reaches its set temperature it turns off the
   fuel solenoid and stops the flow of fuel into the burner chamber,
   and turns it back on when temperature drops below the thermostat
   setting.
 * All combustion heaters have an 'overheat' cutoff switch.
 * Compared to single-engine heaters, it's **unlikely for carbon
   monoxide to enter the cabin.**
    * The burner chamber has *low pressure* air which is vented to the
      outside.
    * The surrounding pipe has higher pressure than the inside.
    * Therefore, in the vent of a leak the high pressure air would flow
      into the chamber and out the exhaust.

**Bleed Air Heating Systems**

 * Used on turbine aircraft.
 * Extremely hot compressor bleed air is ducted into a chamber where
   it's mixed with ambient or re-circulated air to cool it to a
   useable temperature. It's then ducted into the cabin.
 * Includes temperature sensors to prevent excessive heat from
   entering the cabin, check valves to prevent a loss of compressor
   bleed air when starting the engine and when full power is
   required, and engine sensors to eliminate the bleed system if
   the engine becomes inoperative.
