# Aircraft Design, Certification, and Airworthiness

The FAA certifies three types of aviation products: **aircraft, aircraft
engines, and propellors.** These standards are in Title 14 of the Code
of Federal Regulations - CFR 14.

Different airworthiness standards apply to different categories of aviation
products:

 * Normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes - 14 CFR
   **part 23**
 * Transport category airplanes - 14 CFR **part 25**
 * Normal category - 14 CFR **part 27**
 * Transport category *rotorcraft* - 14 CFR **part 29**
 * Manned free balloons - 14 CFR **part 31**
 * Aircraft engines - 14 CFR **part 33**
 * Propellors - 14 CFR **part 35**

Some aircraft are considered "special classes", such as gliders and
powered lift. Their airworthiness standards are combinations of
14 CFR parts 23, 25, 27, and 29.

The FAA issues a **Type Certificate (TC)** when they are satisfied the
aircraft meets the standards. When the TC is issued, a **Type Certificate
Data Sheet (TCDS)** is generated that specifies the important design and
operational characteristics. TCDS documents are available from the FAA.

During the manufacturing process, each part is inspected to ensure it's
been built exactly according to the approved design. This inspection is
called a **conformity inspection**.

**Airworthiness Certificate**

*When the aircraft is complete*, including airframe, engine, and propellor,
it's inspected and the FAA issues an airworthiness certificate, which
**must be carried on the aircraft during all flight operations.**

Airworthiness certficiates are either **standard** (white) or **special**
(pink). Standard certs are issued for normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter,
or transport category aircraft. Special certs are issued for primary,
restricted, limited category aircraft, and light sport aircraft (LSAs).
They are also issued for **ferry permits** and **experimental aircraft**.
