# Lift and Basic Aerodynamics

We'll briefly touch on aerodynamics, and expand on them later.

**The Four Forces**

 * Thrust:
   * The forward force produced by the powerplant/propellor. It opposes
     the force of drag. It's said to act parallel to the longitudinal
     axis (but isn't always the case, explained later).
 * Drag:
   * Rearward force caused by disruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage,
     and other protruding objects. Opposes thrust, and acts parallel to
     the relative wind.
 * Weight:
   * Combined load of the aircraft, crew, fuel, cargo, etc. Pulls the
     aircraft downward because of the force of gravity. **Acts downward
     through the airplane's center of gravity (CG).** Opposes lift.
 * Lift:
   * Produced by the dynamic effect of air acting on the wing. Opposes
     weight. **Acts *perpendicular to the flight path* through the aircraft's
     center of lift (CL).**

**Axis of Rotation**

 * Longitudinal: runs from front to back. Airplane rolls about this axis.
 * Latitudinal: runs from left to right. Airplane pitches about this axis.
 * Vertical: runs from top to bottom. Airplane yaws about this axis.

**Center of Gravity**

CG is the specific point where the maxx or weight of an aircraft can be
said to center. If you suspended the aircraft from a string from its CG,
the aircraft would remain level.

The postion of the CG determines the stability of the aircraft. **As the
CG moves rearward, the aircraft becomes more and more dynamically unstable.**

# Major Airplane Components

**Fuselage**

The central body of an airplane, designed to accommodate crew, passengers,
and cargo. The most common types of construction today are monocoque, and
semimonocoque (discussed more later). Older types used an open truss made
out of wood, steel, or aluminium tubing.

**Wings**

Airfoils attached to each side of the fuselage, providing the main lifting
surfaces. Can be attached at the top, middle, or bottom of the fuselage:
high-, mid-, or low-wing respectively.

The trailing edge of the wing has flaps and ailerons. Ailerons are on the
outside, flaps on the inside. Important because a wing stalls from the
wing root outward to the wing tip, meaning that in a stall the ailerons
will be as effective for as long as possible.

The principal structural parts of the wing are spars, ribs, and stringers.
These are reinforced by trusses, I-beams, tubing, or other devices,
including the skin. The **wing ribs** determine the shape of the wing.
Most wings include either an integral fuel tank, or contain flexible
containers (bladders) mounted inside the wing.


**Semi vs. full cantilever wings**

Many high wings have external braces, called **semi-cantilever**. Some
high-wing and most low-wings have a full cantilever wing, designed to
carry the load without external struts.

**Empennage**

Contains the entire tail group, including fixed surfaces (vertical and
horizontal stabilisers), and moveable surfaces (rudder, elevators,
trim tabs).

The rudder is attached to the back of the vertical stabiliser, and is
used to move the airplane's nose left and right. The elevators are
attached to the back of the horizontal stabiliser and moves the
airplane's nose up and down. Trim tabs are used to relieve pressure
from the controls with the control surfaces in a given position.

A second type of empennage includes a **stabilator**, which combines
the horizontal stabiliser and elevator into a single unit.
Stabilators have an **antiservo tab** across their trailing edge,
which moves in the **same direction as the trailing edge of the
stabilator and helps make the stabilator less sensitive.** It
also functions as a trim tab to relieve control pressures.

**Landing Gear**

Can be wheels, floats, or skis. Wheel at the front is tricycle gear
or nosewheel at the rear is conventional gear, or tailwheel.

**Powerplant**

The powerplant usually includes both the engine and propellor. The
**primary** function of the engine is to turn the propellor. It also
produces electrical power, provides a vacuum source for some flight
instruments, and usually provides a source of heat for the cabin.

The engine is covered by a cowling, or **nacelle**, whose purpose is
to streamline the flow of air around the engine to help cool the
engine by ducting air around cylinders.

The **propellor translates rotational force of the engine into
thrust**, pulling the airplane forward. It's a rotating airfoil which
produces lift in a similar way to the wing. Engines may be turned
around to become **pushers** with the propellor at the rear.

**Two factors impact a propellor's effectiveness:**

 * The **angle** of the propellor blade, measured against the hub
   of the propellor, keeps the angle of attack (AOA) relatively
   constant along the span of the propellor blade, reducing or
   eliminating the possibility of a stall. **The amount of lift
   generated by a propellor blade is directly related to its AOA.**
 * The **pitch** of the propellor blade, defined as the **distance
   a propellor would travel in one revolution if it were turning in
   a solid.

These two factors combine to allow a measurement of the propellor's
efficiency. Propellors are usually matched to a specific aircraft/
powerplant combination to achieve the best efficiency at a particular
power setting.

**Subcomponents**

Include the airframe, electrical system, flight controls, and brakes.

 * Airframe: basic structure of an aircraft. Designed to withstand
   all aerodynamic forces, along with stresses imposed by weight of
   passengers, cargo, and fuel.
 * Electrical System: primary function is to **generate, regulate, and
   distribute** electricity through the airplane. There are several
   different ways to get this power: engine driven AC generators or
   alternators, APUs, or external power. Designed to operate flight
   instruments, essentials systems (eg. anti-icing), and passenger
   services, such as passenger lighting.
 * Flight Controls: devices which control the attitude of the aircraft,
   and as a result the path of the aircraft.
 * Brakes: in most modern airplanes consist of multiple **caliper
   pads**, that are hydraulically squeezed toward each other with
   a rotating disk (**rotor**) between them. The pads place pressure
   on the rotor, attached to the wheel, causing it and the wheel to
   stop. *Because airplane brakes are used principally during landings,
   their life is measured in landings rather than miles.*
