# Thrust

For an aircraft to start moving, thrust must be greater than drag. It will
continue accelerating until thrust and drag are equal. In order to maintain
constant airspeed, thrust and drag must remain equal. If in level flight,
engine power is reduced, thrust is lessened, and the aircraft slows down. As
the aircraft slows down the drag force is also decreased. The aircraft will
continue to slow until thrust and drag are again equal, when the airspeed will
stabilize.

Straight-and-level flight can be sustained at a variety of speeds, by
coordinating AOA and thrust: lift varies with AOA and airspeed. Therefore,
a high angle of attack and low airspeed can produce the same lift as
low AOA and high airspeed.

**The speed regimes of flight can be characterized into low speed, cruise,
and high speed flight.**

**Straight-and-level flight in the slow speed regime** provides some interesting
conditions relative to the equilibrium of forces. With the aircraft in a nose-high
attitude, there is a *vertical component thrust* that helps support it. For one
thing, wing loading tends to be less than would be expected.

**In level flight, when thrust is increased the airplane speeds up and lift
is increased.** The aircraft will start to climb unless the AOA is decreased.

**Angle of Attack / Critical AOA**

 * As airspeed varies due to thrust, the AOA must also vary to maintain level
   flight.
 * At very high speeds it's possible to have a negative AOA.
 * Conversely, as the airplane slows the AOA must increase to maintain altitude.
 * If speed decreases enough, the AOA will increase to the **critical AOA** -
   where any further increase of the AOA will result in the wing stalling.

# Lift

 * The pilot can control the lift (Coefficient of lift, C<sub>L</sub>) but moving
   the yoke fore and aft.
 * As the AOA increases, lift increases (all other factors being equal).
 * When the aircraft reaches the maximum AOA, lift begins to diminish rapidly.
   This is the stalling AOA, known as C<sub>L-MAX</sub>, or the critical AOA.
 * In order for the airfoil to be effective, it needs to be 'attacking' new
   air constantly:
    * In a helicopter or gyroplane this is achieved by moving the airfoil.
    * In an airplane or glider, this is achieved by movement of the by the
      forward speed of the aircraft.

 > Lift is proportional to the square of the aircraft's velocity.

*For example, an airplane traveling at 200kts has 4x the lift of the same
airplane traveling at 100kts.*

 > **The equation for lift is:**<br>
 > L = (C<sub>L</sub> x &rho; x V<sup>2</sup> x S) / 2

Where:

 * C<sub>L</sub> = coefficient of lift
 * &rho; = air density
 * V = velocity of the airfoil
 * S = surface area of the wing

This shows how lift is proportional to the square of the velocity.

All other factors being constant, for every AOA there is a corresponding
airspeed required to maintain altitude in steady, unaccelerated flight.

**Lift and Weight**

Since an airfoil always stalls at the same AOA, if increasing weight then
lift must be increased. If the AOA is held just short of the critical AOA,
the only option to create more lift as weight is increased it so increase
airfoil velocity.

**Lift and Air Density**

Lift and drag also vary directly with the density of the air. Air density is
affected by pressure, temperature, and humidity. **In order to maintain its
lift at a *higher altitude*, an aircraft must fly at a greater true airspeed
for any given AOA.**

Warm air is less dense than cool air, moist air is less dense than dry air.
**Thus, on a *hot humid day*, an aircraft must be flown at a greater true airspeed
for any given AOA.**

**Lift and Wing Surface Area**

Lift varies directly with wing area, provided there's no change in the wing's
planform. For example, a wing with a planform area of 200 square feet lifts
twice as much as a wing with a planform area of 100 square feet.

# **Study Questions:**

 * **What is the relationship of velocity to lift?**
    * Lift is proportional to the square of the velocity of the airfoil.
 * **What kind of air (temperature and humidity) is less dense, and what does
   that mean for airspeed in unaccelerated straight-and-level flight?**
    * Hot, humid air is less dense. For a given AOA this requires a higher
      true airspeed.
 * **What is the relationship of wing surface area to lift?**
    * Lift is directly portional to the wing's planform surface area.
