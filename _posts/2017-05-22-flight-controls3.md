# Secondary Flight Controls

 * Flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, trim systems

# Flaps

 * Attached to the trailing edge, increase lift and induced drag.
 * Allow a compromise between high cruising speed when retracted, and
   low landing speed when extended.
 * Four common types: **plain, split, slotted, Fowler**

**Plain**

 * Increases the airfoil camber, resulting in a significant increase in
   C<sub>L</sub> (coefficient of lift), and drag.
 * Moves the center of pressure (CP) aft when deployed, resulting in a
   nose-down pitching moment.

**Split**

 * Deflected from the lower surface of the airfoil.
 * Produces a **slightly greater increase in lift than the plain flap,
   and also more drag created** due to the turbulent air pattern produced
   behind the airfoil.

**Slotted**

 * The most popular type of flap on aircraft today.
 * Slotted flaps **increase C<sub>L</sub> significantly more than plain or
   split flaps.**
 * On small airplanes, when extended a slot forms between the wing and the
   leading edge of the flap. High energy air travels from the wing's *lower*
   surface, through the slot, and over the flap's *upper* surface.
    * The high energy air from the slow accelerates the upper surface
      boundary layer and delays airflow separation, providing a higher
      C<sub>L</sub>.
 * Large aircraft often have double or triple slotted flaps, which allow the
   maximum increase in drag without airflow over the flaps separating and
   destroying the lift they produce.

**Fowler Flaps**

 * Fowler flaps are a type of slotted flap.
 * They not only change the camber of the wing, but **also increase the wing
   area** - instead of rotating down on a hinge, they slide back on rails.
 * During the first portion of travel, drag increase is minimal but lift is
   increased due to the extra wing surface and camber.
 * As extension continues the flap deflects downward, meaning it increases
   drag with little additional increase in lift.

# Leading Edge Devices

Three most common types: fixed slots, movable slats, leading edge flaps, and
cuffs.

**Fixed Slots**

 * Direct airflow to the upper wing surface and delay airflow separation at
   higher angles of attack.
 * Does not increase wing camber, but allows a higher max C<sub>L</sub>
   because they delay the stall until the wing's at a higher AoA.

* Movable Slats**

 * Leading edge segments which move on tracks.
 * At low angles of attack, the slats are held against the leading edge by
   the high pressure.
 * As the AoA increases, the high pressure area moves aft, allowing the
   slats to move forward.
 * Some movable slats are pilot operated.
 * Opening a slat allows air below the wing to flow over the wing, delaying
   airflow separation.

**Leading Edge Flaps**

 * Like trailing flaps, are used to increase both C<sub>L</sub> and the
   camber of the wing.
 * Frequently used with trailing edge flaps, and can reduce the nose down
   pitching moment caused by trailing edge flaps.
 * Similar to trailing edge flaps, a small increase provides a big increase
   in C<sub>L</sub> with little increase in drag, but greater increase in
   drag as they are extended further.

**Leading Edge Cuffs**

 * Like leading and trailing edge flaps, are used to increase both
   C<sub>L-MAX</sub> and wing camber.
 * Unlike flaps, they are **fixed aerodynamic devices**.
 * In most cases, they extend the leading edge down and forward, causing
   the airflow to attach better to the upper surface of the wing at high
   angles of attack.
 * Because they're fixed there's a maximum cruise airspeed penalty, but
   modern designs reduce this.

**Spoilers**

 * High drag devices deployed from the wings to spoilt airflow over the wing.
 * **On gliders**, often used to control descent rate. **On airplanes**,
   often used for roll control by helping eliminate adverse yaw.
 * Deploying spoilers on both wings allows the airplane to descend without
   increasing speed. Also deployed to reduce ground roll after landing.

# Trim Systems

 * Consists of a wheel or crank to adjust the trim tab, and a position
   indicator.
 * Placing the control in the full nose-down position moves the tab to
   the full up position. Airflow over the elevator hits the tab, and
   forces the elevator downward. The downard moving elevator creates
   lift, pitching the nose of the aircraft downward. For pitching up,
   the same system works in reverse.

# Balance Tabs

 * Control forces required to move surfaces may be excessive, in which case
   balance tabs are commonly used.
 * They're similar to trim tabs in that they're hinged to a control surface,
   but with the difference that they're automatically moved when the flight
   control for the main surface (eg. aileron) is moved, ultimately requiring
   less pressure to move the surface.
 * Some balance tabs are adjustable from the flight deck, in which case
   the tab functions as both a trim and balance tab.

# Servo Tabs

 * Very similar to trim tabs, a small surface attached to a larger control
   surface, which helps move the entire surface in the direction the pilot
   wants to control it.
 * Used to decrease pilot workload.
 * Sometimes also called **flight tabs**, and **primarily used on large
   aircraft**.
 * **Only the servo tab moves in response to movement of the flight controls,
   and the force of airflow on the servo tab moves the control surface.**

# Antiservo Tabs

 * Work in the same way as balance tabs, except they move in the *same*
   direction as the trailing edge of the stabilator, rather than the
   opposite.
 * In addition to *decreasing the sensitivity of the stabilator*, it
   also functions as a trim device.
    * When the stabilator moves up, a linkage forces the trailing edge
      of the tab up. Conversely, trim tabs on *elevators* move **opposite**
      of the control surface.

# Ground Adjustable Tabs

 * Many small aircraft have a nonmovable metal trim tab on the rudder.
   The tab is bent in one direction or other while on the ground, to apply
   a trim force to the rudder.
 * Usually adjustment is by trial and error, and modified until the aircraft
   no longer skids during normal cruise flight.

# Adjustable Stabilizer

 * Rather than a movable tab on the trailing edge of the elevator, some
   aircraft have an adjustable stabilizer.
 * This configuration **pivots the horizontal stabilizer about it's
   rear spar.**
 * This is accomplished with a jackscrew mounted on the leading edge of
   the stabilator.
    * On small aircraft, the jackscrew is operated with a trim wheel or
      crank. On larger aircraft it's motor driven.


# Autopilot

 * Automatic flight control system which keeps an aircraft in level flight
   or a set course.
 * Can be directed by the pilot or coupled to a nav signal.
 * Reduces physical and mental demands on a pilot.
 * The simplest systems use gyro attitude indicators and mag compasses to
   control servos attached to the flight control system. The number and
   type of servos depends on the complexity of the system.
