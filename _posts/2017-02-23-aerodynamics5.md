# Ground Effect

 * Ground effect is caused by the air trapped between the wing and the landing surface.
 * When an aircraft in flight comes within several feet of the surface (ground or water),
   the vertical component of the airflow around the wing is restricted by the surface.
 * The tail and fuselage are affected by ground effect, but the principal effects are
   changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing.

 > Ground effect is due to the intereference of the ground (or water) surface with
 > the airflow patterns about the aircraft in flight.

**Induced Drag**

 * Induced drag is a result of the airfoil accelerating a mass of air downard.
 * The more **downwash** there is, the harder the wing pushes the mass of air down.
 * At high AOA the amount of induced drag is high; since this corresponds to lower
   airspeeds in flight, it can be said that induced drag is strongest at lower speeds.

**Wingtip Vortices**

 * Ground effect reduces wingtip vortices.
    * The reduction of the wingtip vortices (due to ground effect) alters the
      *spanwise lift distribution* and **reduces the induced AOA and induced
      drag.**

 > Therefore, the wing will require a **lower AOA in ground effect to produce
 > the same C<sub>L</sub>.** If a constant AOA is maintained, an increase in
 > C<sub>L</sub> results.

**Thrust**

 * Since induced drag is predominates (is strongest) at low speeds, the reduction
   of induced drag due to ground effect will cause a **significant reduction of
   thrust required** (parasite + induced drag) at low speeds.
 * Because of the change in upwash, downwash, and wingtip vortices (ie. change
   in airflow around the wing and body), **this may cause position (installation)
   error in the airspeed system** associated with ground effect:
    * In most cases, ground effect causes and *increase in the local pressure
      at the static source, **resulting in a lower indication of airspeed and
      altitude***.

 > Therefore, an aircraft may be airborne at an *indicated* airspeed less than
 > the airspeed normally required.

 > **Ground Effect**
 > As the wing gets closer to the ground, it:
 >  * Requires a smaller angle of attack to produce the same amount of lift
      (C<sub>L</sub>).
 >  * Experiences a *decrease* in induced drag, requiring a decrease in thrust.
 >  * May increase pressure around the static port - airspeed and altitude read
      lower.

**Ground Effect and Takeoff**

Conversely, during takeoff the aircraft leaving ground effect will:

 * Require an increased AOA to maintain the same C<sub>L</sub>.
 * Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust required.
 * Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up change in moment.
 * Experience a reduction in static source pressure, and increase in indicated
   airspeed.

**Practical Application**

Ground effect must be considered during takeoff and landings. For example, if
a pilot fails to understand the effects of ground effect during takeoff, they
might find the airplane flies well below a speed where it's capable of
sustaining flight out of ground effect. As they try to pull out of ground effect
the airplane may sink back down to ground effect or the runway until it has
enough speed to climb again (if at all).

Similarly, during landing, if a pilot doesn't realise that as they approach
being within one wing span of the runway the C<sub>L</sub> will start to
increase for the same AOA and power setting, then they may start to float
down the runway due to the excess airspeed and AOA. The AOA should be
maintained or increased during the flare, which means the thrust must be
removed in order to prevent floating.
