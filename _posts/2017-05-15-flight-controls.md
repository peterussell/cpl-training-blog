# Flight Controls

The most basic flight control systems are mechanical, and use rods, cables,
pulleys, and chains to transmit the forces of the flight deck controls to
the control surfaces. These were used in early aircraft and still used today
in small aircraft where aerodynamic forces are small.

As aircraft got larger and faster, forces acting on the surfaces increased
exponentially. To make the force required by pilots manageable, other designs
like hydromechanical, electric motors, digital computers, or fiber optics
were used.

**Fly by wire** systems replace physical connections between pilot and
control surfaces with an electrical interface. In addition, some large
and fast aircraft **have controls which are boosed by hydraulically or
electrically actuated systems**.

In both fly by wire and boosted systems the control 'feel' is simulated.

**Intelligent Flight Control Systems (IFCS)**

IFCS is being developed by NASA. Its goal is to develop an adaptive neural
network, which adjusts flight based on flight control system feedback errors.
In normal flight it improves aircraft performance, but in case of a failure
of a control surface or airframe damage it allows a pilot to land safely.

# Flight Control Systems

Flight Control Systems are either primary or secondary:

 * Primary: ailerons, elevator (or stabilator), rudder.
 * Secondary: flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, trim systems.
    * These improve performance characteristics, or relieve the pilot of
      excessive control forces.

**Primary Flight Controls**

 * Controls are designed to feel natural; at slow airspeeds they often
   feel slow and sluggish, and at high airspeeds they often feel firm
   and have a more rapid response.
 * Movement of any three primary controls changes the airflow around the
   airfoil, which changes the lift and drag produced by the airfoil,
   and allows the pilot to control the aircraft about the three axes of
   rotation.
 * Design features **limit the amount of deflection** of flight control
   surfaces, eg. control-stop mechanisms in the linkages, or limiting
   movement of the rudder pedals/yoke. The purpose of these is to prevent
   the pilot from overcontrolling and overstressing the airframe.

Flight controls rotate about three axes, and result in three types of
stability:

 * Control surface: Aileron
    * Airplane movement: roll
    * Axis of rotation: longitudinal
    * Type of stability: lateral
 * Control surface: Elevator/stabilator
    * Airplane movement: pitch
    * Axis of rotation: lateral
    * Type of stability: longitudinal
 * Control surface: Rudder
    * Airplane movement: yaw
    * Axis of rotation: vertical
    * Type of stability: directional

**Ailerons**

 * Ailerons are attached to the outboard trailing edge of each wing, and
   move in opposite directions to each other.
 * Connected by cables, bellcranks, pulleys, and/or push-pull tubes to
   a control wheel or stick.
 * Moving the control wheel/stick right moves the right aileron up, and the
   left aileron down. This results in decreased lift on the right, and
   increased lift on the left, raising the left wing and banking to the
   right.

**Adverse Yaw**

 * The downward deflect aileron (left in the previous example) produces
   more lift, it also produces more drag. This causes the lifted wing to
   want to slow down and yaws the airplane toward the lifted wing. This
   is called **adverse yaw**. **Adverse yaw is in the opposite direction
   to the direction of bank**.
 * Adverse yaw is more pronounced at low speeds, since lower aerodynamic
   forces are working on the surfaces and bigger inputs are required. The
   increase in aileron deflection causes an increase in adverse yaw.
 * Application of rudder is used to counteract adverse yaw:
    * The amount of rudder required is **greatest at low airspeeds,
      high angles of attack, and with large aileron deflections**.

In an attempt to minimise adverse yaw, manufacturers developed four systems:

**Differential Ailerons**

 * The ailerons still work in a similar way to the normal case: ie. the
   inside aileron is lifted and the outside aileron is lowered, *but*
   the inside aileron is lifted *more* than the outside ailieron is lowered.
 * This decreases adverse yaw but doesn't eliminate it.

**Frise-Type Ailerons**

 * The aileron being raised pivots on an offset hinge.
 * This projects the leading edge of the aileron into the airflow and
   creates drag, helping equalize the drag on the wings.
 * It also forms a slot so air flows smoothly over the *lowered* aileron,
   making it more effective at high angles of attack.
 * They can also be designed to function differentially.
 * Like differential ailerons, frise-type ailerons don't totally
   eliminate adverse yaw.

**Coupled Ailerons and Rudder**

 * Accomplished with rudder-aileron interconnect springs, which help
   correct for aileron drag by automatically deflecting the rudder.
 * The force on the interconnect springs can be overridden if it's
   required to slip the aircraft.

**Flaperons**

 * Combine flaps and ailerons to eliminate adverse yaw.
 * Can be lowered together to function the same as a dedicated set of
   flaps.
 * A mixer is used to combine the separate pilot inputs into this *single*
   set of control surfaces called flaperons.
 * Many flaperon designs mount the control surfaces away from the wing to
   provide undisturbed airflow at high angles of attack and/or low airspeeds.

# Elevator

 * Controls pitch about the lateral axis, connected to the control
   wheel/stick by a series of linkages.
 * Aft movement of the stick moves the control surface up, which lowers
   the tail and pitches the nose upward. The opposite is true for moving
   the stick forward.
 * Stability, power, thrustline, and position of the horizontal tail
   surfaces on the empennage are factors in elevator effectiveness. For
   example, the tail surfaces may be attached near the bottom, middle,
   or top of the vertical stabilizer.
