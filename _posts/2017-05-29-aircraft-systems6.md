# Ignition System

 * In a **spark ignition** system, the ignition system provides a spark that
   ignites the fuel-air mixture in the cylinders, and made up of:
    * Magnetos
    * Spark plugs
    * High tension leads
    * ignition switch

**Magentos**

 * A magneto uses a permanent magnet to generate an electrical current **completely
   independent of the aircraft's electrical system**.
 * It provides a voltage enough to jump a spark across the spark plug gap in
   each cylinder.
 * The system begins to fire when the starter is engaged and the **crankshaft**
   begins to turn. It continues to operate **whenever the crankshaft is rotating.**
 * Most standard certified aircraft have a dual ignition system, with two
   magnetos, sets of wires, and spark plugs.
    * Each cylinder has two spark plugs, each of which is connected to one
      magneto.
    * With both mags on, both plugs in each cylinder fire, which also
      **improves combustion of the fuel-air mixture and results in a slightly
      higher power output.**
    * If one magneto fails the other is unaffected (same for spark plugs, or
      spark plug fouling), although there will be a slight reduction in engine
      power.

**Magneto Operation**

Magnetos are controlled from the flight deck, and can be Off, Right, Left, Both,
or Start.

During preflight each magneto should be checked by itself. Expect a drop in RPM
within a tolerance specified by the manufacturer, and the engine continue to run
smoothly.

If the drop in RPM is too great, engine runs rough, or no RPM drop is noticed, the
airplane should not be flown until the problem's rectified.

Following flight, turn the magnetos OFF. **Even with battery and master switches
off, the engine can turn over and fire with the mag switches ON and the propellor
moved, because it requires no external electrical power to function.**

Even in the OFF position, if the ground wire between magneto and ignition (the
'P-lead') is disconnected or broken, the engine could accidentally start. If this
occurs, the only way to stop the engine is to move the mixture to the idle
cutoff position, then have the system checked.

# Oil Systems

Engine oil performs several important functions:

 * Lubrication of moving parts.
 * Cooling by reducing friction.
 * Removing heat from cylinders.
 * Providing a seal between cylinder walls and pistons.
 * Carrying away contaminants.

Reciprocating engines use either a wet sump or dry sump.

 * **Wet-sump:** oil is located in a sump that's an integral part of the engine.
 * **Dry-sump:** oil is contained in a separate tank and circulated through the
   engine by pumps.

 * The main component of a wet-sump system is the **oil pump**
 * The oil pump draws oil from the sump and routes it to the engine.
 * After oil passes through the engine it returns to the sump.
 * In some engines the crankshaft applies additional lubrication by splashing
   oil onto portions of the engine as it rotates.

 * In a dry-sump engine the oil pump also supplies oil pressure, but the source
   is external.
 * After oil is routed through the engine, it's **pumped back to the oil tank
   by scavenge pumps.**
 * *Dry sump engines allow a greater volume of oil to be supplied* meaning they're
   more suitable for very large reciprocating engines.
