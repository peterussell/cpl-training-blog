# Lateral Stability

Lateral stability is stability about the longitudinal axis, and determines the
"rolling effect" that occurs when one wing gets lower than the other. There are
four main design factors that make an aircraft laterally stable:

 1. Dihedral
 2. Seepback
 3. Keel effect
 4. Weight distribution

**Dihedral**

 * Dihedral is the angle formed between the wing roots and wing tips, when looking
   at the airplane from straight ahead or straight behind:
    * Positive dihedral means the wing tips are higher than the roots (slope up).
    * Negative dihedral means the wing tips are lower than the roots (slope down).

> Positive dihedral helps provide lateral stability.

 * When a gust causes a roll, a sideslip will result:
    * The sideslip causes the relative wind affecting the *entire airplane* to
      be from the direction of the slip.
    * When the relative wind comes from the side, the wing slipping into the wind
      (the wing pointing downward on the inside of the 'turn') is subject to an
      increase in AOA and develops more lift.
    * The wing away from the wind (on the upward side) is subject to a decrease in
      AOA and develops less lift.
 * **The changes in lift effect a rolling moment tending to *raise the winward
   wing*, hence dihedral contributes to a stable roll due to sideslip.**

**Sweepback and Wing Location**

Many aspects of an aircraft's configuration can affect its effective dihedral, but
two major components are **wing sweepback** and **wing location with respect to the
fuselage** (high wing or low wing). A sweptback wing is one where the leading edge
slopes backward.

As a rough estimate:

 * 10 degrees of sweepback on a wing providers about 1 degree of effective dihedral
 * A high wing provides about 5 degrees of effective dihedral over a low wing configuration

When a disturbance causes an aircraft with sweepback to slip or drop a wing, the
dropped wing presents its leading edge at an angle that is more perpendicular to the
relative airflow. As a result, the dropped (lower) wing generates more lift, rises,
and the aircraft is restored to its original flight attitude.

**Keel Effect and Weight Distribution**

 * A high-wing aircraft has a tendency to turn the longitudinal axis of the aircraft
   into the relative wind, which is often referred to as the keel effect.
 * High-wing aircraft are laterally stable simply because the wings are attached
   in a high position on the fuselage, making the fuselage behave like a keel,
   exerting a steadying influence on the aircraft laterally along the longitudinal
   axis.
 * **When a high-winged aircraft is disturbed and one wing dips, the fuselage weight
   acts like a pendulum and returns the aircraft to the horizontal level.**

Laterally stable aircraft are constructed so the **greater portion of the keel area
is above the CG.** When the aircraft slips to one side, the combination of the
aircraft's weight and the pressure of airflow against the upper portion of the keel
area (both acting about the CG) tend to rollw the aircraft back to wings-level.

# Directional Stability (Yawing)

Lateral stability is stability about the vertical axis. This is the most easily
achieved stability in aircraft design. The prime contributors are the area of the
vertical fin and sides of the fueselage aft of the CG. These help to make the
aircraft act like a weather vane, pointing its nose into the relative wind.

Thinking about a weather vane, if the same amount of area is exposed to the wind
fore and aft of the CG, then it would be in balance. Therefore, in airplane design
a larger area is exposed *aft* of the CG to help with directional stability. This
is both the tail and vertical stabilizer.

**How it works**

If a wind pushes the tail to the left, then the relative wind coming from the
front of the front of the airplane, would hit the tail on the right side. This
would push the tail back toward the right, thereby correcting the displacement
created by the intial gust.

# Sweepback in Center of Pressure vs. CG

 * In a longitudinally stable aircraft the Center of Pressure is aft of the CG (think
   that you always want the nose to be able to be lowered, which would happen if
   the CoP was behind the CG, and lift was increased).
 * Sometimes the wing can't be attached at a point where it makes this true.
 * In those cases, wing sweepback - normally used to delay compressibility in
   high-speed flight - can be used to move the CoP aft - the amount of sweepback
   combined with wing position then place the CoP in the correct location.
