# Superchargers and Turbosuperchargers

 * Superchargers and turbosuperchargers are forced induction systems; they both
   compress intake air to increase its density.
 * The key difference lies in the power supply:
    * **Supercharger:** relies on engine-driven air pump or compressor.
    * **Turbosupercharger:** gets its power from the exhaust stream that runs
      through a turbine, which spins the compressor.
 * Aircraft with these systems have a **manifold pressure gauge**, which
   displays MAP within the engine's intake manifold.
    * With the engine shut down, the MAP indicates ambient pressure, eg. 29.92 "Hg.

**Service Ceiling**

 * As a normally aspirated aircraft climbs, it eventually reaches an altitude
   where the MAP is insufficient for a normal climb. This altitude limit is the
   **service ceiling**, and is directly affected by the engine's ability to
   produce power.
 * If induction air is pressurized or boosted, the service ceiling can be
   increased.
 * With these systems, aircraft can fly at higher altitudes with the advantage
   of higher true airspeeds and increased ability to navigate adverse weather.

# Superchargers

 * **Engine-driven** air pump or compressor that provides compressed air to the
   engine to provide additional pressure to the induction air.
 * With a naturally aspirated engine, *it is not possible to have manifold
   pressure higher than existing atmospheric pressure.*
    * A supercharger is capable of **boosting manifold pressure above 30 "Hg.**
 * **Components** in a supercharged system are similar to those in a naturally
   aspirated system, with the addition of a supercharger **between the fuel
   metering device and intake manifold.**
 * A supercharger is driven by the engine through a **gear train** at one
   speed, two speeds, or variable speeds.
 * In addition, superchargers can have one or more **stages**. Each stage
   provides an increase in pressure.
    * Superchargers may be classified as single stage, two stage, or multistage
      depending on the number of times compression occurs.

**Sea-level Superchargers**

 * An early version of a single-stage, single-speed supercharger may be
   referred to as a sea-level supercharger, and an engine equipped with this
   called a sea-level engine.
 * Found on many high-powered radial engines.
 * It increases the power produced by an engine, but still suffers a performance
   decrease with an increase in altitude.
 * Use an air intake that faces forward so the induction system can take full
   advantage of the ram air.
    * Intake air passes through ducts to a carburetor, where fuel is metered.
    * The fuel-air charge is ducted to the supercharger, or blower impeller,
      which accelerates the mixture outward.
    * Once accelerated, the mixture passes through a **diffuser**, where air
      velocity is traded for pressure energy.
    * After compression, the high pressure mixture is directed to the cylinders.

**Single-Stage, Two-Level Superchargers**

 * Used on some large radial engines developed during WWII.
 * A single impeller may be operated at two different speeds, the 'low blower'
   and 'high blower' setting, controlled by a lever or switch on the flight
   deck which engages an oil-operated clutch to switch from one speed to the other.
 * Under normal operations takeoff is in the low blower position, where the
   engine performs as a ground-boosed engine and power output decreases with
   altitude.
    * Once the aircraft reaches a *specified altitude*, a power reduction is
      made and the engine switched to high blower position. The throttle is
      then reset to the desired manifold pressure.
    * An engine equipped with this type of supercharger is called an
      **altitude engine**.

# Turbosuperchargers

The most efficient method of increasing horsepower is a turbosupercharger or
turbocharger. This uses exhaust gas to drive a compressor to increase pressure
of the air going into the engine, and boost power at high altitude.

 * The major disadvantage of the gear-driven *supercharger*, namely use of a large
   amount of the engine's power output for an amount of power increase, is
   avoided with a turbocharger, because it uses energy recovered from hot exhaust
   gases that would otherwise be lost.
 * A second advantage over superchargers is the ability to maintain control over
   an engine's horsepower from sea level up to the engine's **critical altitude**.
 * An engine's **critical altitude** is the maximum altitude at which a
   turbocharged engine can produce its rated horsepower.
    * Above the critical altitude, power output decreases like it does for a
      naturally aspirated engine.

**Turbocharger Components**

A turbocharger has two main components: compressor and turbine.

 * **Compressor:** the compressor section houses an impeller that turns at a
   high rate of speed
    * As induction air is drawn across the impeller blades, the impeller
      accelerates the air, allowing a large volume of air to be drawn into
      the compressor housing.
    * This high-pressure, high-density air is delivered to the engine.
 * **Turbine:** the turbine is mounted to the opposite end of the impeller's
   drive shaft, and in the flow of the hot exhaust gas. The exhaust gases
   turn the turbine, which in turn rotates the impeller.
 * By directing different amounts of exhaust gases to flow over the turbine,
   more energy can be extracted, causing the impeller to deliver more compressed
   air to the engine.
 * The **waste gate**, essentially an adjustable butterfly valve installed in
   the exhaust system, is used to vary the mass of exhaust gas flowing toward
   the turbine.
    * When **closed** most gas flows through the turbine,
    * When **opened**, exhaust gases bypass the turbine by flowing directly
      out through the exhaust.

**Intercoolers**

 * Because gas temp rises when it's compressed, turbocharging causes temperature
   of the induction air to increase.
 * To reduce this temperature and reduce the risk of detonation, many turbocharged
   engines use an intercooler.
 * **This small heat exchanger uses outside air to cool the hot compressed air
   before it enters the fuel metering device.**

# System Operation

 * On most modern turbocharged engines, waste gate position is governed by a
   pressure-sensor coupled to an actuator. Engine oil directed to or away from
   this actuator controls waste gate position.
 * On these systems, the waste gate is positioned to produce the desired MAP,
   set by changing the throttle control.
 * Other systems use a manual waste gate position control.
    * With these systems, manifold pressure must be closely monitored to
      determine when the desired MAP has been achieved.
    * Manual systems are often found on aircraft with aftermarket modifications.

**Overboost**
  * Some special considerations are required for manual waste gate controls, for
    example if the waste gate is left closed after descending from high
    altitude, it's possible to produce manifold pressure that exceeds the
    engine's limitations.
     * This condition is called an **overboost**, and may produce severe
       detonation due to the leaning effect (lots of air, little fuel).
 * Although an automatic waste gate is less likely to cause an overboost, it's
   still possible.
    * **If takeoff power is applied while engine oil temp is below its normal
      operating range** the cold oil may not flow out of the waste gate
      actuator fast enough to prevent an overboost.
 * To help prevent an overboost, advance the throttle cautiously.

**Oil Temperature Considerations**

 * A turbocharger turbine and impeller can rtate in excess of **80,000 RPM**
   while at extremely high temperatures.
 * To achieve this, bearings must be constantly supplied with engine oil to
   reduce friction and temperature.
 * Therefore, it's important that **oil is in the normal operating range
   before applying high throttle settings**.
 * In addition, **allow the turbocharger to cool and turbine to slow down before
   shutting down the engine**, otherwise the oil remaining in the bearing
   housing will boil, causing hard carbon deposits to form on the bearings and
   shaft.

# High Altitude Performance / Critical Altitude

 * As a turbocharged aircraft climbs, the waste gate gradually closes. At some
   point the waste gate is fully closed and any further increase in altitude
   causes manifold pressure to decrease. This is called the **critical altitude**.
 * Be aware that if the manifold pressure begins decreasing *before* the
   manufacturer specified critical altitude, the engine and turbocharging
   system should be inspected.
