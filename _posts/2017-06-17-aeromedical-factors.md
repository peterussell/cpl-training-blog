# Medical Certificates

 * Glider and balloon pilots aren't required to have a medical certificate.
 * Sport pilots can have either a medical cert or state-issued driver license.
 * **61.53 requires every pilot to not act as a crewmember if they know, or
   have reason to know, of any medical condition that would make them unable
   to operate the aircraft in a safe manner.**

**Classes of Medical Certificates**

 * Third-class:
    * Required for recreational or private pilot.
    * Valid for 5 years if under 40, or 2 years.
 * Second-class:
    * Required for commercial pilots.
    * Valid for 1 year.
 * Third-class:
    * Required for ATPs.
    * Valid for 1 year if under 40, or 6 months.

 * A pilot with a higher class medical has met the requirements of the lower ones
   as well.
 * **The required medical class applies only when exercising the priveleges of the
   pilot certificate for which it's required.**
    * eg. a first-class is valid for 1 year if exercising the privileges of a
      commercial pilot, or 2 or 5 years, as appropriate, if exercising the
      privileges of a recreational or private pilot.
 * The standards for medical certificates are in Part 67, and requirements for
   obtaining one are in Part 61.

**Physical Limitations**

 * **Students** with physical limitations can be issued a medical certificate valid
   for "student pilot privileges only".
 * Beyond student - may require a limitation on the certificate, eg. impaired
   hearing may require "not valid for flight requiring the use of radio."
 * A **SODA** (Statement Of Demonstrated Ability) is a waiver which can be issued
   when a student can demonstrate the ability to operate the aircraft with a normal
   level of safety.
    * A SODA is valid as long as the impairment doesn't worsen.

**Special Issuance Authorization**
 * Part 67 specifies 15 medical conditions considered disqualifying. Regardless of
   when it was diagnosed or treated, a medical certificate won't be issued except
   through a process called "Special Issuance Authorization".
    * Types of diabetes.
    * Angina pectoris.
    * Coronary heart disease (conditions apply).
    * Myocardial infarction.
    * Cardiac valve replacement.
    * Pacemaker.
    * Heart replacement.
    * Psychosis.
    * Bipolar disorder.
    * Personality disorder that is severe enough to have repeatedly manifested
      itself by overt acts.
    * Substance dependence (including alcohol).
    * Substance abuse.
    * Epilepsy.
    * Disturbance of consciousness without satisfactory explanation of cause.
    * Transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without
      satisfactory explanation of cause.

These are only the mandatory disqualifying conditions, there are more in Part 67.
There are others (cancer, kidney stones) which require review before medical
certificate issuance.

It's important to note that with very few exceptions, all disqualifying medical
conditions may be considered for special issuance.

# Health & Physiological Factors

# Hypoxia

 * Hypoxia means 'reduced oxygen' - the brain is particularly vulnerable to
   oxygen deprivation.
 * Can be caused by: insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation, or
   inability of body tissues to use oxygen. The forms of hypoxia are based on
   their causes:
    * Hypoxic hypoxia.
    * Hypemic hypoxia.
    * Stagnant hypoxia.
    * Histoxic hypoxia.

**Hypoxic Hypoxia**

 * Results from insufficient supply of oxygen to the body as a whole, eg. blocked
   airway, drowning, or being at high altitudes.
 * Although the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere remains constant, the
   reduction in pressure at altitude prevents them from passing through
   membranes in the respitory system.

 * **Dangers of transporting dry ice**
    * Dry ice sublimates (solid > gas) into large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub>,
      which can rapidly displace oxygen in the atmosphere, and **potentially cause
      hypoxia via carbon dioxide intoxication.
    * Case studies have shown that illness and death can be caused by unintentional
      exposure when transporting dry ice in confined spaces, eg. an airplane.
    * The tendency of dry ice to sublimate also means it can rapidly pressurize.
       * For this reason it should never be placed in a sealed transport
         container, and must be placed within an outer shipping container that
         allows adequate ventilation to release the CO<sub>2</sub> gas.
       * **Sealing dry ice in a leak-proof container may lead to explosion.**

**Hypemic Hypoxia**

 * Result of an inability of the blood to take up and transport oxygen.
 * It may be due to reduced blood (eg. severe bleeding), or from certain blood
   diseases, eg. anemia.
 * More often, it's because hemoglobin (the blood molecule that transports
   oxygen) is chemically unable to bind oxygen molecules.
    * **The most common form of hypemic hypoxia is CO poisoning.**
 * Hypemic hypoxia can also occur following blood donation due to a lack of
   blood volume - blood can take weeks after a donation to return to its normal
   volume. Symptoms may not be noticeable on the ground but can be dangerous
   at altitude.

**Stagnant Hypoxia**

 * Stagnant means 'not flowing' - stagnant hypoxia (or ischemia) results when
   oxygen-rich blood in the lungs is not flowing to the tissues that need it.
 * **Pins and needles** caused by blood flow being cut off to a limb is one
   example of stagnant hypoxia.
 * It can result from shock, the heart failing to pump blood effectively, or
   a restricted artery.
 * During flight, **stagnant hypoxia can be caused with excessive acceleration
   of gravity (Gs).**
 * Cold temperatures can also reduce circulation.

**Histoxic Hypoxia**

 * The inability of cells to effectively use oxygen. In this case, enough oxygen
   is being provided to the cells, but they're unable to use it.
 * Can be caused by alcohol and other drugs, such as narcotics and poisons.
    * Research has shown that drinking 1oz of alcohol can equate to an additional
      2,000' of altitude.

**Symptoms of Hypoxia**

 * First symptoms are often euphoria and a carefree feeling.
 * Then the extremities become less responsive and coordinated.
 * Symptoms vary by individual, but include:
    * Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips).
    * Headace.
    * Decreased response to stimuli, increased reaction time.
    * Impaired judgement.
    * Euphoria.
    * Visual impairment.
    * Drowsiness.
    * Lightheaded or dizziness.
    * Tingling in fingers and toes.
    * Numbness.

**Treatment of Hypoxia**

 * Flying at lower altitudes.
 * Using supplemental oxygen.
 * **Time of Useful Consciousness:** the amount of time a pilot has to make
   rational, life-saving decisions, and carry them out without using supplemental
   oxygen.
    * As altitude increases above 10,000', symptoms of hypoxia increase in
      severity, and time of useful consciousness rapidly decreases.

# Hyperventilation

 * The excessive rate and depth of breathing, leading to an abnormal loss of
   carbon dioxide from the blood.
 * Seldom incapacitates completely, but can lead to unconsciousness due to the
   respiratory system's overriding mechanism to regain control of breathing.
 * Many symptoms are similar to hypoxia, so it's important to diagnose correctly -
   if using supplemental oxygen, check operation of the equipment to ensure the
   symptoms are not hypoxia related.
    * Visual impairment.
    * Unconsciousness.
    * Lightheaded or dizzy sensation.
    * Tingling sensations.
    * Hot and cold sensations.
    * Muscle spasms.
 * Treatment involves restoring the proper level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the body.
   Breathing normally is the best prevent and cure.
    * Breathing into a paper bag, or talking aloud helps overcome hyperventilation.
    * Recovery is normally rapid.
