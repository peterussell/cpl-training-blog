# Vision in Flight

 * Eyes function like a camera, the structure contains an apeture,
   lens, focusing mechanism, and a surface for registering images.
 * Light enters through the **cornea** at the front of the eyeball,
   travels through the **lens**, and falls on the **retina**.
 * The retina contains cells which convert light energy into
   eletrical energy which travels to the brain. There are two types
   of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones.

**Cones**

 * Responsible for all color vision.
 * Concentrated toward the center of the retina.
    * There is a small pit called the **fovea** where all
      light-sensing cells are cones. This is the area where detail,
      color sensitivity, and resolution are highest.

**Rods**

 * Better at detecting movement and vision in dim light, but
   unable to discern color.
 * A large amount of light overwhelms them, and they take longer to
   reset (adapt to the dark again).
 * This explains why **in low light, the center of vision isn't very
   perceptive, but off-center viewing is.**

There are three types of vision, based on what type of cells they're
using.

 1. **Photopic Vision**
     * Uses cones, only functions in good light.
     * Provides capability for seeing color and resolving fine detail.
     * Rod cells are less effective.
 2. **Mesopic Vision**
     * Uses a combination of rods and cones.
     * Experienced during dawn, dusk, and bright moonlight.
     * Visual acuity steadily decreases as available light decreases,
       and color perception changes because the cones are less
       effective and the rods take over.
     * **Mesopic viewing period is considered the most dangerous
       period for viewing.** As cone sensitivity decreases, use off-
       center viewing and proper scanning techniques.
 3. **Scotopic Vision**
     * Uses only rods, used under low light.
     * Poor resolution of detail. People must stand at 20 fee to see
       what could otherwise be seen at 200 feet (20/200 or less).
     * Color perception is lost, and a **night blind spot in the
       central field of fiew** appears.

**Central Blind Spot**

 * The area where the optic nerve connects to the back of each eye
   is known as the optic disk. There are no rods or cones in this
   area.
 * In normal binocular vision (both eyes) this isn't a problem
   because the blind spots are in different positions, but when
   looking through one eye it's possible to not see an object in
   the blind spot.

# Empty Field Myopia

 * Occurs usually occurs above clouds or haze where there's nothing
   specific to focus on.
 * Causes the eye to relax and seek a comfortable focus distance at
   10-30'.
 * **Searching out distant light sources helps prevent the onset of
   empty field myopia.**

# Night Vision

These are visual conerns related to night flying that are important
to know about.

**Night Blind Spot**

 * Rods are the primary receptors at night, about 10,000x more senstive
   than cones in low light.
 * The concentration of cones in the fovea (center) can make a night
   blind spot in the center of the field of vision.
 * **To see an object at night, expose rods to the image by focusing
   5 to 10 degress of center.**

**Dark Adaptation**

 * Cones adjust rapidly, rods take much longer (and are used for night
   flying), which is why it's faster to adapt going dark to light,
   and slower going light to dark (eg. night flying).
 * **Rods can take approx. 30 minutes to fully adapt, but a bright
   light can completely destroy night adapation.**

**Scanning Techniques**

 * Should scan in sections approximately 30 degrees wide. No stop
   should last more than 2-3 seconds.
 * When moving from one section to the next, overlap by 10 degrees.
 * With **off-center vision, the images of an object viewed longer
   than 2-3 seconds will disappear.**
    * Rods reach a photochemical equilibrium, preventing any further
      response until the scene changes.
    * **Avoid viewing an object for longer than 2-3 seconds.**

**Night Vision Protection**

 * **Sunglasses** - wear sunglasses when exposed to bright sunglight
   if a night flight is scheduled.
 * **Oxygen** - lack of O<sub>2</sub> to rods (hypoxia) significantly
   reduces their sensitivity.
    * **Night vision declines measurably at pressure altitudes
      above 4,000'.**
 * **High Intensity Lighting** - attempt to avoid high intensity
   lights. Attempt to plan route to avoid direct flight over built-up,
   brightly-lit areas.
 * **Flightdeck Lighting** - keep as low as possible. After reaching
   altitude, take time to adjust to flight conditions, eg. adjust
   instrument lights, orient to outside references.
 * **Airfield Precautions**
    * Reduce lighting to lowest usable intensity.
    * Maintenance personnel should maintain light discipline.
    * Position the aircraft on the field with the least lighting.
    * Select approach/departure routes that avoid highways and
      resedential areas.

**Self-Imposed Stress**

Many self-imposed stressors can limit night vision.

 * **Drugs** - can seriously degrade vision, always check with an
   AME if uncertain.
 * **Exhaustion** - fatigued pilots will respond more slowly, and
   tend to concentrate on a single aspect of a situation. May also
   fail to use proper scanning techniques and get fixated.
 * **Poor physical conditioning** - physically fit people get less
   fatigued during night flight, and have better scanning efficiency.
   Be aware that too much exercise may also lead to fatigue.
 * **Alcohol** - is a sedative, impairs coordination and judgement.
   Tend to neglect good scanning, and can directly impair vision
   long after consumption.
 * **Tobacco** - **the most impactful of all stressors**. Significantly
   increases carbon monoxide carried by hemoglobin, preventing
   oxygen from being carried. Affects peripheral vision and dark
   adaptation.
 * **Nutritional deficiency** - missing or postponing meals can cause
   low blood sugar, can cause stomach contractions, distraction,
   shortened attention span.
    * **Vitamin A** - while it doesn't improve night vision, a lack
      of it does impair it. Vitamin A rich foods: eggs, butter,
      cheese, liver, apricots, peaches, carrots, squash, spinach,
      peas, most types of greens.

**Distance Estimation and Depth Perception**

There are a number of things which can affect depth perception at
night.

 * **Motion Parallax** - apparent movement of stationary objects,
   by an observer moving across a landscape.
    * Looking out parallel to direction of motion, **near objects
      appear to move backward, far objects appear to move forward
      or remain fixed.**
 * **Geometric Perspective** - object may appear to have different
   shapes when viewed from different distances/angles. Three types:
    1. **Linear Perspective** - parallel lines, eg. runway lights,
       tend to converge as distance increases.
    2. **Apparent foreshortening** - true shape of an object appears
       eliptical when viewed from a distance.
    3. **Vertical position in the field** - farther objects appear
       higher on the horizon than near objects.
 * **Aerial Perspective** - **clarity** and **shadow** are clues
   for perceving distance, the closer the observer the more subtle
   the changes they can see are. As distance increases they become
   blurry.
 * **Binocular clues** - rely on the object being close enough to
   the observer that different eye distances provide depth
   perception, not used much in aircraft given the distances involved.

# Night Vision Illusions

**Autokinesis**

 * Caused by staring at a single point of light against a dark
   background for more than a few seconds.
 * The light appears to move on its own.
 * To prevent: avoid fixating, look at objects at different
   distances.

**False Horizon**

 * Occurs when the natural horizon is obscured or not readily
   apparent.
    * eg. bright stars confused with city lights, or flying
      toward an angled short of a beach or large lake.

**Reversible Perspective Illusion**

 * An aircraft **may appear to be moving away when it's actually
   getting closer.**
 * Often occurs when flying a parallel course.
 * Should use the **intensity of lights** as an indicator of
   aircraft distance (getting dimmer = moving away).

**Size-Distance Illusion**

 * Light source that's increasing or decreasing in brightness may
   cause the illusion it's moving closer or further.

**Flicker Vertigo**

 * A light flickering between 4 and 20 Hz can produce reactions,
   eg. vomiting, vertigo.

# Night Landing Illusions

 * **Featureless Terrain** - tendency to fly a lower than normal
   approach (think you're higher than you are).
    * Also applies for any obscuring phenomena, eg. rain/haze.
 * **Bright lights, surrounding terrain, wide runways** can cause
   the illusion of being lower than actual, and fly a higher than
   required approach.
    * **Particularly true if few other lights are around (black
      hole).**
 * **Road lights** can appear to be runway lights, also trains.
